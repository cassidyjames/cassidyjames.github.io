# Cassidy’s Desk

I work 100% remotely—mostly from my home. As such, I’ve built myself a nice little workspace centered around a nice big motorized sit/stand desk.

It’s gone through some revisions due to rearranging our home and moving; here is what currently makes it up, as well as a historical log of past iterations.
