# The "elementary" Desk

[elementary](https://elementary.io) is a completely remote company, and hundreds of folks from around the world contribute from their home. Over the years, a few contributors have started building similar workspaces based on one another's feedback. This page is an attempt to specify an unofficial "elementary" desk, as determined by those of us who have similar setups.
