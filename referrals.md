# Cassidy’s Referrals

Services or products I recommend. If you sign up/purchase using these links, you'll save money and I may get a small cut.

## Autonomous **Up to $200 off**

Autonomous makes motorized standing desks, standing desk kits, office chairs, and accessories. They're relatively affordable for the quality you get, and have a ton of options.

I have their home office SmartDesk DIY Kit in black (though I wish I would have gotten white to match other furniture!). I've slapped an IKEA Gerton tabletop on top for an awesome motorized convertible sit/stand desk.

## Google Fi **$20 credit**

Phone service from Google. Straightforward pricing, fast data, wide coverage (uses T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, and more), unlimited calls and texts. Choice for Flexible plan where you pay for data you use (up to a price cap, then data is free), or Unlimited which is pretty traditional.

My family uses Google Fi and loves it. We save money when we use Wi-Fi, and international travel is stupid simple (same data speeds and rates, no extra costs or work).

## Soylent **$10 off subscription**

Soylent's mission is to make complete, sustainable nutrition accessible, appealing, and affordable to all. In reality… they make yummy meal-replacement drinks (and other products). For each new subscription through Friend Referral, Soylent will donate $1 toward World Food Program USA.

I like the pre-made drinks for the convenience of a nutritionally-complete meal or snack with zero prep or cleanup. My favorite flavors are Mint Chocolate and Strawberry.
