bio: |
  Cassidy is passionate about designing and building useful, usable, and delightful products using open technologies. In the past he co-founded elementary OS and served as the chief experience architect, and he's worked as a UX architect, web developer, and writer—and worn many, many other hats. He contributes to GNOME and the Flatpak ecosystem.

  Outside of work and open source he enjoys photography, video games, watching and reading almost everything Star Wars, collecting way too much media on his Plex server, and being a dad.
