bio: |
  Cassidy is passionate about building communities and useful, usable, delightful products and experiences using open technologies. In the past he co-founded elementary, Inc. and served as the chief experience architect, and he's worked as a community architect, partner success engineer, UX architect, web developer, and writerâ€”and worn many, many other hats. He is a director at the GNOME Foundation, contributing to the GNOME and Flathub ecosystems.

  Outside of work and open source he enjoys playing single-player video games, building LEGO, 3D printing, automating his smart home, watching and reading almost everything Star Wars, spending time with his best friend (his wife, Katie), and being the dad of his two young kids.
