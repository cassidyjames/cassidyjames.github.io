description: Why I only support Flatpak and distribute on Flathub
---

My apps are only officially distributed as Flatpaks via Flathub. Any other distribution of my apps is not supported by me.

While I openly-license my work so others can learn, contribute, and adapt them, the burden of third-party packaging means that as a policy, I will not condone nor support the repackaging of my apps. Issues with versions of my apps that are repackaged by others may be closed if I cannot reproduce them using the Flatpak version.

I chose Flatpak precisely because it can run on all modern Linux distros, is widely adopted by DEs (GNOME, KDE, Pantheon), and helps ensure my apps work the same everywhere. I already have extremely limited time and develop apps purely for fun; I'm not going to spend that time doing something un-fun like figuring out why my app is inaccessible to the screen reader on Ubuntu when packaged as a Snap, or looks wrong when coming from the AUR on Manjaro running Gradience, etc.
