# Cassidy’s Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
## Skip Amazon
</summary>

I dislike Amazon since they’re extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.

**Buying from the company who makes the thing is usually best**, but I also recommend the following stores as they seem well-designed and reliable:
- [Target](https://target.com) - Their online shopping is actually quite good, plus there's the convenience of picking up in store (and thus skipping shipping costs).
- [Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com/) - Probably the best selection, as they partner with _a ton_ of large and small retailers like Target, Best Buy, Costco, Fry's, Home Depot, etc.
</details>

## Shortlist

_A.k.a. a small number <!--(3–7)--> of things I’d absolutely love._

## GiftHero Wishlist

I'm trying GiftHero as a more traditional, sprawling wishlist. It's sort of sorted by priority by default, but you can sort by price as well. It includes shortlist items plus a whole bunch of stuff.

## LEGO

_A.k.a. gifts for someone who grows older but refuses to grow up._

I have a LEGO wishlist at [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames). It’s usually kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome.

## Experiences

_A.k.a. stuff to do instead of just… stuff._

* Meow Wolf tickets (opening in Denver, 2020)
* Regal Cinemas movie tickets (date night!)
* Denver museum or zoo tickets
* [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](https://denvercenter.org) gift certificate
* _Panic! at the Disco_, _Fall Out Boy_, or _Twenty-One Pilots_ concert tickets

## Idea-list

_A.k.a. stuff I always enjoy._

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/0g-8mm-filter) **~$5–20** - 0g/8mm, single- or double-flared. I like almost anything! I have a lot of black, so lighter-colored wood, unique designs, and bright colors would be best. Hot Topic also usually has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.

* Hubless Wi-Fi Smart Lighting **~$10–\$\$\$\$** - Feit smart bulbs, LIFX bulbs, smart switches, etc. are all very welcome. Ideally every bulb in my home would be smart… maybe someday.

<!--
* [Wikimedia clothing](https://store.wikimedia.org/collections/men) **$18–40** - Anything there! I like all the designs and I like supporting Wikimedia.

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://www.threadless.com) **~$10–30** - Men’s Large. Anything nerdy or fun or cool.

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **~$9-20** - Men’s Large. Some sort of oatmeal color, anything heather, or any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like bright colors, plain or simple patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically any place with men’s clothes works.

* [MKBHD tees](http://shop.mkbhd.com) - Basically anything you think looks cool or that I would like. Men's large.

* Star Wars Blu-ray + Digital **~$20–30 each** - I have Episodes I–VII. I do **not** have _Episode VIII: The Last Jedi_, _Rogue One_, or _Solo_.

* Nintendo Switch stuff - Pro controller, JoyCons, etc.

* Funko Pop! Star Wars bobbleheads. Ones I really want:
  - Jyn Erso
  - Boushh Leia
  - Death Trooper
  - Scarif Stormtrooper
-->

* Board/Card/Party Games **~$10–50** - I love simple and fun games to play with friends.
