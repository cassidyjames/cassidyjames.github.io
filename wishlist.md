# Cassidy‚Äôs Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is
up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**

## Skip Amazon

I dislike Amazon since they‚Äôre extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.

Buying from the company who makes the thing is usually best, but I also recommend the following stores as they seem well-designed and reliable:
- [Google Express](https://express.google.com/) - Probably the best selection, as they partner with _a ton_ of large and small retailers like Target, Best Buy, Walmart, Costco, Fry's, Home Depot, etc.
- [Target](https://target.com) - Their online shopping is actually quite good, plus there's the convenience of picking up in store (and thus skipping shipping costs).

## Shortlist

A small number (3‚Äì7) of things I‚Äôd absolutely love to get. You can use it as a surefire way to get me something I‚Äôll love, or as inspiration for getting me something else.

## Stuff I Always Enjoy

I don‚Äôt have specific items picked out here, but I always love receiving a variety of these things. Pick something you think I‚Äôll like!

* [Moment gear](https://www.shopmoment.com/) **Huge range** - Macro and Superfish lens, carrying cases, gimbals, etc. It all looks awesome and I am a Moment fiend. I have a phone case and three lenses (Wide, 58mm Tele, Anamorphic), but not much else.

* Star Wars Blu-ray + Digital **~20‚Äì30 each** - I have Episodes I‚ÄìVII. I do **not** have _Episode VIII: The Last Jedi_, _Rogue One_, or _Solo_. 

* [Harry &amp; David Pears](https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/fruit-gift/pears) **~$30** - Pears are the BEST.

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter) **~$5‚Äì20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared. I like almost anything! I have a lot of black/dark wood, so lighter wood, unique designs, and bright colors would be best. Hot Topic also usually has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://threadless.com) **~$10‚Äì30** - Men‚Äôs Large. Anything nerdy or fun or cool.

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **~$9-20** - Men‚Äôs Large. Some sort of oatmeal color, anything heather, or any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like bright colors, plain or simple patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically any place with men‚Äôs clothes works.

* [MKBHD tees](http://shop.mkbhd.com) - Basically anything you think looks cool or that I would like. Men's large.

* Gift Cards **any amount** - I shop at all of these places and always appreciate gift cards.

  * [PlayStation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/) for games üéÆ
  * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/giftcards/) for apps, movies, books, and games üì±
  * Micro Center (only available in-store) for Raspberry Pi and gadget stuff ü§ì
  * [GameStop/ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/gift-cards) for games and geek stuff üé≤
  * [LEGO Store](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Give-Gift-Card) for LEGOs, obviously üèó
  * [Target](https://www.target.com/c/target-giftcards/all-occasions/-/N-5xsxtZ5rxa0) for whatever ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  * [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/gift-cards/cat09000.c?id=cat09000#/) for gadgets üë®‚Äçüíª
  * [Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/customerService/info.do?cid=35433) for fashion üï∫
  * [Sprouts](https://www.sprouts.com/giftcards) for the best gummy bears on Earth üëÖ

* Board/Card/Party Games **~$10‚Äì50** - I love simple and fun games to play with friends, like Exploding Kittens, Codenames, Little Drop of Poison, and Fluxx (all of which Katie and I have). Other ideas:
  * Exploding Kittens expansions
  * Codenames expansions (I have the base/standard set)
  * Liar‚Äôs Dice (homemade set would be rad)
  * Star Realms
  * Telestrations

## LEGO

I have a LEGO wishlist at [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames). It‚Äôs usually kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome.

## Experiences

Instead of getting me _stuff_, you can gift me with one of these experiences or subscriptions.

* Regal Cinemas movie tickets (date night!)
* Denver museum or zoo tickets
* [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](https://denvercenter.org) gift certificate
* _Panic! at the Disco_ or _Fall Out Boy_ concert tickets

## Causes

Instead of giving to me directly, you can always give to one of these causes on my behalf. I‚Äôm passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.

* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) _Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation._
* [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) _A worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all software users._
* [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/) _Helping create a free software computing platform for the general public that is designed to be elegant, efficient, and easy to use._
