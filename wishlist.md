# Cassidy’s Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**

<details open="open" markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
## Skip Amazon
</summary>

I dislike Amazon since they’re extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.

**Buying from the company who makes the thing is usually best**, but I also recommend the following stores:
- [Target](https://target.com) - Their online shopping is great, plus there's the convenience of picking up in store skipping shipping costs.
- [Micro Center](https://microcenter.com) - They usually have all the Raspberry Pi stuff and lots of other electronics and accessories.
- [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.com) - Pretty competitive for most electronics, aside from cheaper things like small accessories. In-store pickup is great.
- [ClockWorkSynergy](https://www.clockworksynergy.com/) or [Barton Watch Bands](https://www.bartonwatchbands.com/){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: Barton Watch Bands');"}  for watch bands/straps.
- [Arctic Buffalo](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/0g-8mm-filter) or [So Scene](https://www.soscene.com/0-gauge-8mm/){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: So Scene');"} for jewelry (guages/plugs).
- [Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com/) - Huge selection since they partner with _a ton_ of large and small retailers like Target, Best Buy, Costco, Fry's, Home Depot, etc. However, they changed it recently and it's a little harder to use.

## Gift Hero Wish List

Gift Hero is a more traditional, sprawling wish list. It's _sort of_ sorted by priority by default, but you can sort by price as well. It includes shortlist items, things from the idea list, and a whole bunch more.

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">

## Idea-list

_A.k.a. stuff I always enjoy._

### Pins **$5+**

I collect quality pins for my backpack—like ones with good backs, not the cheapo button ones—from cool causes, artists, and places. You can find some examples on my Gift Hero list, but I'm open to anything you think I'd like.

### Watch bands/straps **$13–25**

**18mm two-piece quick-release is required for my watch**

I have a coral silicone strap, a white cordura strap, and a black and gray striped NATO strap, but I enjoy swapping out the watch bands on my Fossil Sport. It's the 18mm red model, so white, black, and red colors go well with it.

[ClockWorkSynergy](https://www.clockworksynergy.com/){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: ClockWorkSynergy');"} and [Barton Watch Bands](https://www.bartonwatchbands.com/){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: Barton Watch Bands');"} are pretty affordable sources with lots of variety, but Fossil and others also sell watch bands/straps.

### Fun gauges/plugs **$5–20**

**0g/8mm size**

I like almost anything! Bright colors, unique designs, and interesting patterns are always good. I like [Arctic Buffalo](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/0g-8mm-filter){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: Arctic Buffalo');"} and [So Scene](https://www.soscene.com/0-gauge-8mm/){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: So Scene');"} since they're both pretty affordable with a lot of variety. Hot Topic also usually has a fun assortment.

### Board/card/party games **$10–50**

I love simple and fun games to play with friends.

### Wall art **$???**

I have a nice little desk space since I work from home, and I could use a couple more pieces of art. Currently I have a black/gold circuit board print and a red/blue robot print.

## LEGO

_A.k.a. gifts for someone who grows older but refuses to grow up._

I have a LEGO wishlist at [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: Brickset');"}. It’s usually kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome.

## Causes

_A.k.a. do good on my behalf!_

Instead of giving to me directly, you can always give to one of these causes. I’m passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.

>Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation.

### [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/){: onclick="plausible('Wishlist: GNOME Foundation');"}

>Helping create a free software computing platform for the general public that is designed to be elegant, efficient, and easy to use.
