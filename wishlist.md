# Cassidy’s Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is
up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**

## Skip Amazon

I dislike Amazon since they’re extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.

Buying from the company who makes the thing is usually best, but I also recommend the following stores as they seem well-designed and reliable:
- [Google Express](https://express.google.com/) - Probably the best selection, as they partner with _a ton_ of large and small retailers like Target, Best Buy, Walmart, Costco, Fry's, Home Depot, etc.
- [Target](https://target.com) - Their online shopping is actually quite good, plus there's the convenience of picking up in store (and thus skipping shipping costs).

## Shortlist

A small number <!--(3–7)--> of things I’d absolutely love to get. You can use it as a surefire way to get me something I’ll love, or as inspiration for getting me something else. Arranged in descending price—but not necessarily any sort of ranked/preference—order.

## Idea-list

_A.k.a. stuff I always enjoy._

* Smart Lighting **~$10–\$\$\$\$** - Wemo outlets and switches, IKEA TRÅDFRI bulbs, Feit smart bulbs, LIFX bulbs, etc. are all very welcome. Ideally every bulb in my home would be smart… maybe someday.

* Star Wars Blu-ray + Digital **~$20–30 each** - I have Episodes I–VII. I do **not** have _Episode VIII: The Last Jedi_, _Rogue One_, or _Solo_.

* [Harry &amp; David Pears](https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/fruit-gift/pears) **~$30** - Pears are the BEST.

<!--
* [Wikimedia clothing](https://store.wikimedia.org/collections/men) **$18–40** - Anything there! I like all the designs and I like supporting Wikimedia.

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter) **~$5–20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared. I like almost anything! I have a lot of black/dark wood, so lighter wood, unique designs, and bright colors would be best. Hot Topic also usually has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.
* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://www.threadless.com) **~$10–30** - Men’s Large. Anything nerdy or fun or cool.

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **~$9-20** - Men’s Large. Some sort of oatmeal color, anything heather, or any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like bright colors, plain or simple patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically any place with men’s clothes works.

* [MKBHD tees](http://shop.mkbhd.com) - Basically anything you think looks cool or that I would like. Men's large.
-->

* Nintendo Switch stuff - Pro controller, JoyCons, etc.

* Funko Pop! Star Wars bobbleheads. Ones I really want:
  - Sabine
  - Jyn Erso
  - Boushh Leia
  - Death Trooper
  - Scarif Stormtrooper

* Gift Cards **any amount** - I shop at all of these places and always appreciate gift cards.
  * [PlayStation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/) or [Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/giftcards) for games 🎮
  * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/giftcards/) for apps, movies, books, and games 📱
  * Micro Center (only available in-store) for Raspberry Pi and gadget stuff 🤓
  * [GameStop/ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/gift-cards) for games and geek stuff 🎲
  * [LEGO Store](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Give-Gift-Card) for LEGOs, obviously 🏗
  * [Target](https://www.target.com/c/target-giftcards/all-occasions/-/N-5xsxtZ5rxa0) for whatever 🤷‍♂️
  * [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/gift-cards/cat09000.c?id=cat09000#/) for gadgets 👨‍💻
  * [Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/customerService/info.do?cid=35433) for fashion 🕺
  * [Sprouts](https://www.sprouts.com/giftcards) for the best gummy bears on Earth 👅
  * [Arctic Buffalo](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/gift-options/products/gift-card?variant=1040675312) for gauges/plugs 👂

* Board/Card/Party Games **~$10–50** - I love simple and fun games to play with friends, like Exploding Kittens, Codenames, Little Drop of Poison, and Fluxx (all of which Katie and I have). Other ideas:
  * Exploding Kittens expansions
  * Liar’s Dice (homemade set would be rad)
  * Telestrations

## LEGO

I have a LEGO wishlist at [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames). It’s usually kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome.

## Experiences

Instead of getting me _stuff_, you can gift me with one of these experiences or subscriptions.

* Meow Wolf tickets (opening in Denver, 2020)
* Regal Cinemas movie tickets (date night!)
* Denver museum or zoo tickets
* [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](https://denvercenter.org) gift certificate
* _Panic! at the Disco_, _Fall Out Boy_, or _Twenty-One Pilots_ concert tickets

## Causes

Instead of giving to me directly, you can always give to one of these causes on my behalf. I’m passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.
