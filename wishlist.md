# Cassidy’s Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
## Skip Amazon
</summary>

I dislike Amazon since they’re extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.

**Buying from the company who makes the thing is usually best**, but I also recommend the following stores as they seem well-designed and reliable:
- [Target](https://target.com) - Their online shopping is actually quite good, plus there's the convenience of picking up in store (and thus skipping shipping costs).
- [Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com/) - Probably the best selection, as they partner with _a ton_ of large and small retailers like Target, Best Buy, Costco, Fry's, Home Depot, etc.

## GiftHero Wishlist

I'm trying GiftHero as a more traditional, sprawling wishlist. It's sort of sorted by priority by default, but you can sort by price as well. It includes shortlist items, things from the idea list, and a whole bunch more.

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">

## Idea-list

_A.k.a. stuff I always enjoy._

### Pins **$5+**

I've started collecting quality pins for my backpack—like ones with good backs, not the cheapo button ones—from cool causes, artists, and places.

### Watch bands/straps **$13–25**

**18mm two-piece quick-release is required for my watch**

I have a coral silicone set and a white cordura set, but I enjoy swapping out the watch bands on my Fossil Sport. It's the red model, so white, black, and red colors go well with it. [ClockWorkSynergy](https://www.clockworksynergy.com/) is pretty affordable, but Fossil and others also sell watch bands/straps.

### Fun gauges/plugs **$5–20**

**0g/8mm size**

I like almost anything! Bright colors, unique designs, and interesting patterns are always good. I like [Arctic Buffalo](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/0g-8mm-filter) since they're pretty affordable. Hot Topic also usually has a fun assortment.

### Hubless Wi-Fi smart lighting **$10–\$\$\$**

Feit smart bulbs, LIFX bulbs, funky light art, etc. are all very welcome. Ideally every bulb in my home would be smart… maybe someday.

### Board/card/party games **$10–50**

I love simple and fun games to play with friends.

### Wall art **$???**

I have a nice little desk space since I work from home, and I could use a couple more pieces of art. Currently I have a black/gold circuit board print and a red/blue robot print.

## LEGO

_A.k.a. gifts for someone who grows older but refuses to grow up._

I have a LEGO wishlist at [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames). It’s usually kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome.

## Causes

_A.k.a. do good on my behalf!_

Instead of giving to me directly, you can always give to one of these causes. I’m passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.

### [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)

>Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation.

### [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/)

>Helping create a free software computing platform for the general public that is designed to be elegant, efficient, and easy to use.

### [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/)

>Closing the gender gap in tech, one girl at a time.

### [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)

>Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.
