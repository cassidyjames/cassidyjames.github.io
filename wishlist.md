# Cassidy’s Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is
up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**


## Shortlist

A small number (3–7) of things I’d absolutely love to get. You can use it as a surefire way to get me something I’ll love, or as inspiration for getting me something else.

## Stuff I Always Enjoy

I don’t have specific items picked out here, but I always love receiving a variety of these things. Pick something you think I’ll like!

* [Harry &amp; David Pears](https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/fruit-gift/pears) **~$30** - Pears are the BEST.

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter) **~$5–20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared. I like almost anything! I have a lot of black/dark wood, so lighter wood, unique designs, and bright colors would be best. Hot Topic also usually has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://threadless.com) **~$10–30** - Men’s Large. Anything nerdy or fun or cool.

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **~$9-20** - Men’s Large. Oatmeal, black, gray, or any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like bright colors, plain or simple patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically any place with men’s clothes works.

* Gift Cards **any amount** - I shop at all of these places and always appreciate gift cards.

  * [PlayStation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/) for games
  * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/giftcards/) for apps, movies, books, and games
  * Micro Center (only available in-store) for Raspberry Pi and gadget stuff
  * [GameStop/ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/gift-cards) for games and geek stuff
  * [LEGO Store](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Give-Gift-Card) for LEGOs, obviously
  * [Target](https://www.target.com/c/target-giftcards/all-occasions/-/N-5xsxtZ5rxa0) for whatever
  * [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/gift-cards/cat09000.c?id=cat09000#/) for gadgets
  * [Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/customerService/info.do?cid=35433) for fashion
  * [Caribou Coffee](https://shared.caribouperks.com/giftcard/) for coffeeeee
  * [Sprouts](https://www.sprouts.com/giftcards) for the best gummy bears on Earth

* Board/Card/Party Games **~$10–50** - I love simple and fun games to play with friends, like Exploding Kittens, Codenames, Little Drop of Poison, and Fluxx (all of which Katie and I have). Other ideas:
  * Exploding Kittens expansions
  * Codenames expansions (I have the base/standard set)
  * Liar’s Dice (homemade set would be rad)
  * Star Realms
  * Telestrations


## LEGO

I have a LEGO wishlist at [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames). It’s kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome.


## Experiences

Instead of getting me _stuff_, you can gift me with one of these experiences or subscriptions.

* Regal Cinemas movie tickets (date night!)
* Denver museum or zoo tickets
* [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](https://denvercenter.org) gift certificate


## Causes

Instead of giving to me directly, you can always give to one of these causes on my behalf. I’m passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.

* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) _Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation._
* [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) _A worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all software users._
* [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/) _Helping create a free software computing platform for the general public that is designed to be elegant, efficient, and easy to use._
* [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) _Closing the gender gap in tech, one girl at a time._


## Amazon

I dislike Amazon since they’re extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.
