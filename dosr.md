# Denver Open Source Remoters Club

We are a group of Open Source contributors in the Denver area who work remotely
and enjoy not going insane from a lack of human contact. We meet up around
Denver once a week at coffee shops, libraries, and other cool spaces to get work
done in the presence of other Open Source peeps.

## Join Us

Anyone working in, working with, or interested in Open Source software is
welcome to come hang out and work with us. Just remember this isn't a social
hour, it's a time for us all to get work done while being around other Open
Source people. Of course before, after, and breaks are all great times to
socialize and meet people!
