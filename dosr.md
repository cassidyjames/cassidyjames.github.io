# Denver Open Source Remoters Club

**Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DOSR meetups are cancelled for the foreseeable future.** You are still welcome to join the Get Together community for notifications about future events once they resume.

We are a group of Open Source contributors in the Denver area who work remotely and enjoy not going insane from a lack of human contact. We meet up around Denver once a week at coffee shops, libraries, and other cool spaces to get work done in the presence of other Open Source peeps.

## Join Us

Anyone working in, working with, or interested in Open Source software is welcome to come hang out and work with us. Just remember this isn't a social hour, it's a time for us all to get work done while being around other Open Source people. Of course before, after, and breaks are all great times to socialize and meet people!
