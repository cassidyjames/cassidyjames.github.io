## Where does Ahsoka fit in?

Ahsoka Tano is a former Jedi trained by Anakin Skywalker during the **Clone Wars**. She left the Jedi Order after being falsely accused of a plot against the Jedi and the Republic.

Ahsoka developed a friendship with Mandalorian **Bo-Katan Kryze**, and later helped the Mandalorians and Republic capture **Maul**. Later on she joined early **Rebels** of Phoenix Squadron including captain **Hera Syndulla**, Jedi Kanan Jarrus, Mandalorian **Sabine Wren**, and Jedi-in-training **Ezra Bridger**. Ahsoka fought alongside the rebels, going up against Maul, Darth Vader, the Inquisitors, and the Empire's **Grand Admiral Thrawn**.

During her time with the rebels, she experienced the mysterious **World Between Worlds** in a Jedi temple on Ezra's home planet, Lothal. She parted ways with the Rebellion on a quest to find Ezra Bridger, who was last seen being pulled into hyperspace towards the Unknown Regions with Thrawn.

### What to Watch

You should probably have seen _The Mandalorian_, at the very least. _The Book of Boba Fett_ helps fill in some events between _The Mandalorian_ seasons 2 and 3 as well.

If you want to go all out, I would recommend _The Clone Wars_ and _Rebels_ animated series—you don’t have to watch every episode (but might appreciate the character more if you do); I have a guide for [The Clone Wars], and here is [another site’s recommendation for both shows](https://www.gamesradar.com/ahsoka-the-clone-wars-rebels-essential-episodes-star-wars/) which looks good at a glance.

### Timeline

The _Ahsoka_ series takes place around the same time as _The Mandalorian_ and _The Book of Boba Fett_, which is around five years after _Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi_ and 25 years before _Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens_.
