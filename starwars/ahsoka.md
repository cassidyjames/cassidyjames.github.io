## Where does Ahsoka fit in?

Ahsoka Tano is a former Jedi trained by Anakin Skywalker during the **Clone Wars**. She left the Jedi Order after being falsely accused of a plot against the Jedi and the Republic.

Ahsoka developed a friendship with Mandalorian **Bo-Katan Kryze**, and later helped the Mandalorians and Republic capture **Maul**. Later on she joined early **Rebels** of Phoenix Squadron including captain **Hera Syndulla**, Jedi Kanan Jarrus, Mandalorian **Sabine Wren**, and Jedi-in-training **Ezra Bridger**. Ahsoka fought alongside the rebels, going up against Maul, Darth Vader, the Inquisitors, and the Empire's **Grand Admiral Thrawn**.

During her time with the rebels, she experienced the mysterious **World Between Worlds** in a Jedi temple on Ezra's home planet, Lothal. She parted ways with the Rebellion on a quest to find Ezra Bridger, who was last seen being pulled into hyperspace towards the Unknown Regions with Thrawn.

### What to Watch & Read

You should probably have seen _The Mandalorian_, at the very least. _The Book of Boba Fett_ helps fill in some events between _The Mandalorian_ seasons 2 and 3 as well.

If you want to better understand Ahsoka and her backstory, I would recommend _The Clone Wars_ and _Rebels_ animated series—you don’t have to watch every episode (but might appreciate the character more if you do); I have a guide for [The Clone Wars], and here is [another site’s recommendation for both shows](https://www.gamesradar.com/ahsoka-the-clone-wars-rebels-essential-episodes-star-wars/) which looks good at a glance.

For extra credit (and if you have time…), I would highly recommend reading/listening to the two most recent _Thrawn_ trilogies: _Thrawn_ (2017), _Thrawn: Alliances_ (2018), _Thrawn: Treason_ (2019), plus _Thrawn Ascendency: Chaos Rising_ (2020), _Thrawn Ascendency: Greater Good_ (2021), and _Thrawn Ascendency: Lesser Evil_ (2021). **Thrawn will likely play an important role in the Ahsoka series**, and these books provide an excellent back story and motivations to a fascinating character who is much more than a classic villain. The author, Timothy Zahn, has been involved with the Ahsoka series as well.

The original Thrawn books (from 1991 through 2006) may be interesting background material, but are considered non-canon legends. The Ahsoka series may pull characters/traits, locations, plot lines, references (like calling Thrawn “Heir to the Empire”), but they aren't required reading for the series at all.

### Timeline

The _Ahsoka_ series takes place around the same time as _The Mandalorian_ and _The Book of Boba Fett_, which is around five years after _Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi_ and 25 years before _Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens_.
