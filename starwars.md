## The Clone Wars _Episode Guide_

![The Clone Wars](/images/starwars/clone-wars.jpg)

I don't claim to be an expert on Star Wars canon or _The Clone Wars_, but I do have some thoughts! The 3D-animated _The Clone Wars_ show is incredible; it expands the canon and lore of Star Wars itself, it develops and gives insight into beloved characters, and it introduces characters that are becoming central to the new canon stories.

But there is also so. much. Clone. Wars. And there's a lot of… uh, more kid-oriented episodes and arcs—especially involving Jar Jar Binks and droids. So, this is my attempt at picking out the essential _The Clone Wars_ episodes, aimed at expanding on and filling in details of the canon—especially anything that is now cropping up in _The Mandalorian_.

Also, a disclaimer: _The Clone Wars_ kind of has a timeline problem; episodes were not aired or numbered in their chronological order. It is mostly fine, but if you find things jumping around a little bit (especially if watching all of it), that's why.

### The Clone Wars Movie

Not really essential, though it introduces Ahsoka Tano. But in non-spoiler-y summary: Ahsoka Tano is a young Jedi padawan assigned to Anakin. In the movie, you get to see her learning from Anakin and their master/apprentice, teacher/learner relationship develop. She calls Anakin "skyguy" (a nickname that sticks throughout the series), and she gets the nickname "snips" for being a bit snippy with him. Anakin starts to learn to trust Ahsoka, and it's obvious she is picking up on his improvisational and often defiant style.

### Season One

Not much of Season One is essential viewing, actually. There are a lot of clone-focused episodes and some focused more on Padme, Jar Jar, and the introduction of Cad Bane (a bounty hunter whose character I just… hate). The Ryloth arc, however, is worthwhile because it shows some Ahsoka development, and the cost of the war.

Ep | Title               | Details
:- | :----               | :------
9  | Cloak of Darkness   | Ahsoka development, introduction of Master Luminara
19 | Storm Over Ryloth   | Ahsoka character development
20 | Innocents of Ryloth | Introduces Cham Syndulla and continues Ryloth arc
21 | Liberty on Ryloth   | Continues and concludes the Ryloth arc

### Season Two

Season Two introduces Mandalore, the Mandalorians, Death Watch, and a whole bunch of stuff related to _The Mandalorian_ show. While none of this is _required_ to understand and enjoy the events of _The Mandalorian_, it fills in a lot of backstory and lore. It also features the Holocron arc and some good Ahsoka/Barriss-focused episodes with the Geonosis arc.

Ep | Title                 | Details
:- | :----                 | :------
1  | Holocron Heist        | Kicks off the Holocron arc with Cad Bane (boo) that might have implications in canon? Or at least fills in some major character motivations/implications.
2  | Cargo of Doom         | Continues Holocron arc, features Ahsoka
3  | Children of the Force | Concludes the Holocron arc
5  | Landing at Point Rain | Kicks of Geonosis arc, featuring Ahsoka
6  | Weapons Factory       | Focuses on Ahsoka and introduces Barriss, continues Geonosis arc
7  | Legacy of Terror      | Continues Geonosis arc (less essential, but might as well watch)
8  | Brain Invaders        | Fun "weird" episode, focuses on Ahsoka and Barriss, concludes the Geonosis arc
11 | Lightsaber Lost       | Not essential, but a standalone Ahsoka-focused episode
12 | The Mandalore Plot    | Hoo boy, kicks off the Mandalore arc and is required viewing
13 | Voyage of Temptation  | Continues Mandalore arc, good Obi-Wan and Anakin development
14 | Duchess of Mandalore  | Continues Mandalore arc, Death Watch, Republic occupation of Mandalore
20 | Death Trap | Boba Fett

### Season Three

There's some Mandalore-related stuff, but I really enjoy the Nightsisters and the implications they have on canon. Also, the Mortis arc is Star Wars getting weird, and I love it.

Ep | Title               | Details
:- | :----               | :------
5  | Corruption          | Mandalore
6  | The Academy         | Ahsoka, Mandalore
7  | Assassin            | Ahsoka
12 | Nightsisters        | Introduces Dathomir, Nightsisters and their arc
13 | Monster             | Introduces Savage Opress (yes, really), continues Nightsisters arc
14 | Witches of the Mist | Continues Nightsisters arc
15 | Overlords           | Star Wars gets weird and I love it; kicks off Mortis arc
16 | Altar of Mortis     | More weirdness, Anakin development
17 | Ghosts of Mortis    | More weird, Anakin development
21 | Padawan Lost        | Ahsoka
22 | Wookiee Hunt        | Ahsoka

### Season Four

Season Four includes the Umbara arc which I just enjoy, and has… implications. Some light Mandalore stuff, and then back to the Nightsisters and Maul.

Ep | Title              | Details
:- | :----              | :------
7  | Darkness on Umbara | Kicks off the Umbara arc
8  | The General        | Continues the Umbara arc
9  | Plan of Dissent    | Continues the Umbara arc
10 | Carnage of Krell   | Concludes the Umbara arc
14 | A Friend in Need   | Ahsoka and Mandalorian-related, I think?
19 | Massacre           | Back to Dathomir and the Nightsisters
21 | Brothers           | Maul
22 | Revenge            | Maul
