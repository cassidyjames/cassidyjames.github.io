# Cassidy's Wi-Fi

`cassidyjames.com/wifi` is a guest network that you are free to use **if you agree to the terms below**. It may be limited bandwidth-wise, so streaming and stuff may not work so great. But if you need to use the Internet, here you go.

## Agreement

_By using this network, you agree:_

<label for="agree-illegal"><input id="agree-illegal" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> To not do anything illegal on this Wi-Fi connection.</label>

<label for="agree-unsecured"><input id="agree-unsecured" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> That this may be an unsecured Wi-Fi network, which means others may be using it and spying on your web traffic.</label>

<label for="agree-responsible"><input id="agree-responsible" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> That Cassidy James Blaede or anyone associated with him shall not be held responsible for anything you or others do on this Wi-Fi connection.</label>

<label for="agree-considerate"><input id="agree-considerate" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> To try to be a considerate neighbor (in general) and not totally hog this Internet connection (specifically).</label>

<label for="agree-ephemeral"><input id="agree-ephemeral" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> That this network has no guarantees, warranties, or promises of any kind. It could stop working at any time.</label>

**By using this network, you agree to each and every one of the above statements.** If you do not agree with one or more of the statements, immediately disconnect and cease using this network.

## Password

If you need a password:

1. **Read the terms** above. Seriously.
2. If you agree to the terms, use the password `I agree to the terms!`, including the exclamation point. Alternatively, scan this QR code:

## Butâ€¦ why?

Why would I throw a free Wi-Fi network up? Because COVID-19 and social distancing suck, and we have bandwidth to spare. That's it.

If you feel obligated to thank me or something, contact me with one of the methods below. If you wanna throw money at me/my family (**not** required or expected at all!), see [cassidyjames.com/pay](/pay).
