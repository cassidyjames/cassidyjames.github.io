# Cassidy's Wi-Fi

This is an open guest network that you are free to use **if you agree to the terms below**, and as long as it exists. It's pretty limited bandwidth-wise, so streaming and stuff probably won't work so great. But if you need to use the Internet, here you go.

## Agreement

<label for="agree"><input id="agree" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> I agree not to do anything illegal on this Wi-Fi connection.</label>

<label for="agree"><input id="agree" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> I agree that Cassidy James Blaede or anyone associated with him shall not be held responsible for anything I do on this Wi-Fi connection.</label>

<label for="agree"><input id="agree" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> I agree to try to be a considerate neighbor (in general) and not totally hog this Internet connection (specifically).</label>

**By using this network, you agree to each and every one of the above statements.**
