# Cassidy's Wi-Fi

This is an open guest network that you are free to use **if you agree to the terms below**, and as long as it exists. It's pretty limited bandwidth-wise, so streaming and stuff probably won't work so great. But if you need to use the Internet, here you go.

## Agreement

_By using this network, you agree:_

<label for="agree-illegal"><input id="agree-illegal" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> To not do anything illegal on this Wi-Fi connection.</label>

<label for="agree-unsecured"><input id="agree-unsecured" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> That this is an unsecured Wi-Fi network, which means others may be using it and spying on your web traffic.</label>

<label for="agree-responsible"><input id="agree-responsible" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> That Cassidy James Blaede or anyone associated with him shall not be held responsible for anything you or others do on this Wi-Fi connection.</label>

<label for="agree-considerate"><input id="agree-considerate" type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /> To try to be a considerate neighbor (in general) and not totally hog this Internet connection (specifically).</label>

**By using this network, you agree to each and every one of the above statements.** If you do not agree with one or more of the statements, immediately disconnect and cease using this network.
