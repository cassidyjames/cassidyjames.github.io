## Advice for Better Photos

**Your subject is most important, and editing is second!**

Most modern phones have good to excellent cameras, but your subject is going to be the most important piece of a photo. Stop, think about what you want to photograph, and try several different angles/versions of the shot. Accessories and the latest flagship cameras are cool, but the basics are more important.

And almost any photo with a good subject can be salvaged in the edit; try the built-in editor on your phone, or something more extensive like Snapseed to really get into it.

## Gear

While gear doesn't make or break a photographer, it's fun to nerd out about it and share my kit with others.

- **Phone:** Pixel 3 (128 GB, Clearly White)
- **Case:** Usually naked (üò±Ô∏è), but Moment Photo Case with strap for photography
- **Lenses:** Moment Tele, Wide, Anamorphic, or Macro depending on the situation
- **Tripod:** Sunpak 4200XL
- **Mount:** Shoulderpod Handle Grip S2
- **Remote shutter:** 8Bitdo controller (yes, really!)
