description: My experiences and recommendations

I’ve been using smart home gadgets and accessories practically since they existed; I moved to an apartment in Denver nearly a decade ago in 2014, and have been looking for ways to smarten, automate, and have fun with home tech ever since.

What I’ve found frustrating over that entire time is that it has been hard to find a balance between simplified advice and overly-technical advice while also avoiding the excessive pay-to-rank schemes that seem to have overrun all the tech blogs. When there is advice, it glosses over extremely important details, or weirdly focuses in on inconsequential bits.
