For the past three and a half years, Iâ€™ve done the most rewarding work of my life with [Endless Access](https://endlessaccess.org) (formerly Endless OS Foundation). Iâ€™ve helped ship Endless OS on computers to tens of thousands of people in need around the globeâ€”people who might not otherwise have access to a real computer and especially reliable access to all of the offline knowledge and tools that come out of the box. Iâ€™ve visited students and teachers in the rural US who are struggling due to a lack of funding, and watched as their eyes lit up when they got ahold of Endless Key, an app packed full of safe and fun offline materials to support their self-guided learning. And Iâ€™ve helped learners and educators both unlock so much creativity and skill-building with our game-making learning programs and related open source projects.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end: due to strategic decisions at the organization, my particular role wonâ€™t exist in the coming months. That said, I have some time to look for my next challenge and adventureâ€”and I am excited to do so purposefully.

### What _is_ next?

At the end of the day, my family has to eat and we have to pay for a roof over our heads; otherwise, retiring into the wilderness to raise my kids, garden, and play with LEGO would sound pretty nice right about now! Given that I need a decent income to support us, I'm currently looking for a role with some combination of the following: 

- open source
- connecting people
- empowering people to build things
- tech for good

These are both broad and vague because I don't have a perfect vision of what I want; my ideal job would hit all four of those, but I'm also a realist and know that I might not be able to support my family with some utopian gig working on something like GNOME with my specific skills and experience. (That said, if youâ€™d like to hire me for that, Iâ€™m all ears!) I would love to continue working at a nonprofit, but Iâ€™m open to a company that is strongly aligned with my values. Iâ€™d prefer to work on a core product that is open source, but I could see myself working for an org that at least substantially supports open source. I donâ€™t think I want to be a community managerâ€”unless I can be convinced the org knows precisely what they want and that lines up with my approachâ€”but I do have a passion for connecting with people and helping them.

And donâ€™t worry: no matter what I end up taking on next, I plan to keep my volunteer position on the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors and stick around the GNOME and Flathub communities to help as much as I am able. ðŸ˜‰
