title: De-Googling
---

I don‚Äôt believe corporations can be inherently "good" or "evil." However, I believe it is important to consider the motivations behind companies' business models, and better understand how they track you, use your data, etc. Consequently, I'm attempting to de-Google my life a little bit. For some services, I know and accept the risks vs. the utility they bring me. For others, I have decided I would like to give up less of my data to an all-important account that runs my digital life.

### Progress so far

#### Chrome

Moving away from Google Chrome was _probably_ the easiest migration. I'm not a huge user of bookmarks or extensions, so those weren't tying me down. On the desktop, I just switched to a combination of [Ephemeral](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral/) (as my defaut), Epiphany (as my main "real browser"), and Firefox (for when something doesn't work right in Epiphany). Since Epiphany supports Firefox Sync, it's actually pretty easy to jump between the two as needed. I do have Chromium installed for testing web development in a Chrome-based engine, but I don't use it for any real browsing.

Ephemeral is a lightweight privacy browser that I develop for elementary OS, so of course I dogfood it and have it set as the default. A key feature is that you can pop sites open in your "real" browser with one click, so I usually have that set to Epiphany‚Äîa native GTK browser that comes with elementary OS, so it's an obvious choice. However, some sites don't perform well in it, so I do keep Firefox around for that. And Firefox on the desktop has gotten really good.

For a long time, Chrome was the only browser I liked on Android, though. Others either felt non-native due to scrolling physics (like Firefox was), had questionable monetization incentives, or had too many features I didn't care about. However, Firefox on Android has come leaps and bounds in the last several months, and an even better, entirely rebuilt version is coming this spring. I've switched to it full-time on my phone and have not looked back. Plus, sync with desktop Firefox (and Epiphany!) makes it all work well together.

#### Gmail

I've wanted to have more control over my email for a long time, and consequently migrated most accounts to non-@gmail.com email addresses that were set up as forwarders on my website's domain. As such, there are very few emails that actually go to my Gmail address. **This is a first step I recommend anyone even remotely thinking about de-Googling perform**; getting your email address out of the hands of any given company and owning it yourself is useful, but takes time to catch and change old accounts, inform (and remind!) old friends, etc. Do it early to prevent headaches later.

Since most of my email was set up via forwarders, I am currently trialing Fastmail as a full-on replacement to Gmail for my primary email service. Google requires a Gmail address for your Google account, so the actual account will likely remain open for some time‚Äîbut I might look into a "vacation response" that informs people of my non-@gmail.com address in case anyone still uses the old one. The nice part of owning my email address is that if I end up not loving Fastmail, I can easily move to another provider without anyone knowing or caring.

So far, however I really like Fastmail. I've used them in the past and have spoken with a few people at the company and they seem like good people doing good things.

#### Android

I do not currently plan to move away from Android. It is the most mature and usable open source OS we have, and the only real alternative today is the closed-source and too-restrictive iOS. I'll probably share more thoughts on my reasons for not loving iOS later. :)

I do believe modern Android is not as useful without Google's proprietary services on top (like Play Store, Play Services, Cloud Messaging, etc.), which is a huge bummer‚Äîand makes an eventual migration to a different OS easier for me to imagine.

#### Pixel

As long as I'm using Android, I feel like I should use it as it was designed. Pixel has also proven to be more secure than most other smartphones, gets updates faster than any Android phones, and is supported longer than most. Plus, I am in love with the incredible camera.

I am currently using a Pixel 3, and have not been impressed with what I've heard about the battery life of the Pixel 4‚Äîplus all modern smartphones are too damn big, and I would love to not have to get an even bigger phone if I upgrade. What my next phone will be is in limbo, but the Pixel 3 is serving me well at the moment.
