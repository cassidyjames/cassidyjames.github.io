Throughout the years, I've noticed several recurring misuses of terms in user interfaces. Designers or developers often don't know when to use one term over another, or what the difference between two similar terms is. These really are grammar rules, but they specifically apply to user interfaces.

As a general rule, if there is a term with two words and another term with those two words written as one word, the former is considered a verb and the latter is considered a noun.

### Log In vs. Login

**Log In**: _(verb)_ To authenticate or provide an identity to a website, app, or service.

> Katie **logged in** to Facebook.

**Login**: _(noun)_ 1. One's credentials or identity for a website, app, or service. 2. The specific page, section, or feature that provides functionality for logging in.

> 1. Katie provided her **login** to Facebook.
> 2. Katie visited the **login** page.

1. It's best to avoid using **login** for credentials as it can be confusing to users. Instead, specifying "username and password" or similar required credentials is more explicit.
2. **Login** can be useful when referring to pages internally, but should be avoided in user-facing text in favor of the action verb **log in**.

### ...and Log On

**Log On**: _(verb)_ 1. Usually synonymous with **log in**. 2. _Informal:_ to visit a website.

> 1. **Log on** to the computer.
> 2. **Log on** to www.example.com to see our latest posts.

1. It's best to avoid this one as well since **log in** is more common.
2. A better term would be "visit."

### Sign In

**Sign In**: _(verb)_ Synonymous with **log in**.

> Katie **signed in** to Facebook.

Using **sign in** versus **log in** is a preference. However, be sure to use only one of the terms, and use it consistently.

### Log Out and Sign Out

**Log Out**: _(verb)_ 1. The opposite of **log in**. To deauthenticate from a website, app, or service. 2. _Informal:_ to leave or close a website, app, or service.

> 1. Katie **logged out** of Facebook so her sister could log in.
> 2. Katie **logged out** of the website by closing the window.

1. Logging out should be an explicit action.
2. Although **log out** is commonly used this way informally (especially by those who are less computer literate), it's best to avoid it.

**Sign Out**: _(verb)_ Synonymous with **log out**.

Always use the parallel verb for your **log in** or **sign in**.

### Set Up vs. Setup

**Set Up**: _(verb)_ To prepare or initiate.

> Katie **set up** the computer for her sister.

**Setup**: _(noun)_ The process that involves preparing or initiating.

> Katie performed the **setup** of the computer.

### Less vs. Fewer

**Less**: a smaller amount when the item is not countable.

> Katie has **less** hair than her sister.

**Fewer**: a smaller amount when the item is countable.

> Katie has **fewer** hairbrushes than her sister.

If the subject you're comparing is not commonly referred to as a countable quantity of individual items, i.e. lots of sand, use **less**.

If it _is_ commonly referred to as a countable quantity of individual items, i.e. three _grains_ of sand, use **fewer**.

If you're unsure, ask yourself, "Is it how _much_ or how _many?_" Much = less, many = fewer.
