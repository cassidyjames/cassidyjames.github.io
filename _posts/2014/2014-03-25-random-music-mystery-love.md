Daniel For√© shared this song with me and I thought it was pretty groovy/funky. It's by [+Hugo Millwood](https://plus.google.com/100841130929908678097/)'s band _Galaxy Cat_ over on [Bandcamp](https://galaxycat.bandcamp.com/). Check it out!

Also, Hugo has given elementary permission to use his music in promos and whatnot, so don't be surprised to see that featured somewhere. ;)
