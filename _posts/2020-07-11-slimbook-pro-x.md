Slimbook recently had a [Linux-related developer promotion](https://slimbook.es/en/developers) where they called for anyone ‚Äúinvolved with an open source project, developing for a Linux distribution, programming for GNU or even for the Linux Kernel‚Äù to contact them for the opportunity to get Slimbook hardware at a discount or possibly for free to help them with their work.

I applied on behalf of my work on elementary, and to my surprise, they chose me! A few weeks later, a refurbished [Slimbook Pro X][pro-x] showed up at my door. If you follow me on Twitter, this may be old news:

Ignoring the garbage livestream quality (I have since gotten a new router, I should blog about that‚Ä¶), I cover most of my legit first-impressions there. It was the first time I‚Äôd seen a Slimbook model up close in person, and I wasn't even entirely sure what I was getting.

For those who don't wish to watch a 20-min video and/or want my thoughts after having used it for a few weeks now, here are some thoughts.

**Again, Slimbook provided this refurbished Slimbook Pro X model to me for my work on elementary, free of charge. That does not affect my thoughts or opinions about it, but I am pointing it out for full disclosure.**

### Hardware

The Slimbook Pro X came to me with elementary OS 5.1 Hera pre-installed, which was a nice touch. But let's talk hardware first.

#### It's (concerningly?) lightweight

The most consistent thing I‚Äîand others when I hand it to them‚Äîthink about this hardware is, "It's _so light!"_ Like, to the point where I was honestly concerned if there was even any hardware inside it when I picked it up for the first time. It may seem silly, but it reveals a few things:

1. Magnesium‚Äîand whtever other materials they're employing here‚Äîis a great material for making lightweight laptops.

2. A glass touchscreen (like on [my Dell Precision 5530](/5530)) adds a _ton_ of heft‚Äîin addition to all the glare.

3. The battery is smaller than I'd like; just over half of the size of the one in [my Dell Precision 5530](/5530).

I would have to do a teardown (maybe eventually, but not today!), but I also wonder if the internal design is as efficient as it could be. Yes, a lightweight laptop is _great_ for throwing in a bag, and the Slimbook Pro X delivers there. But, is there just empty space inside? How is it so lightweight? If there's unused space, could it have been made thinner or even smaller in its other dimensions?

I realize I've now spent several paragraphs on something that may seem trivial, but it is just so _absolutely_ jarring when you pick it up that it's deserved.

#### It's (usually) silent

In my use of the Slimbook Pro X, it's a _very_ quiet machine. The fans stay quiet or entirely off most of the time. But there's a catch here: I don't usually use the NVIDIA graphics.

The Slimbook Pro X packs an NVIDIA GPU, even in its very slim and lightweight package. Specifically, it comes with an NVIDIA Geforce MX250 and 2GB GDDR5 memory. I personally opt for good-enough integrated Intel graphics, but I had mentioned the relative lack of NVIDIA hardware as a way Slimbook could help out‚Äîand they delivered here.

When you kick that NVIDIA card on, the fans seem to spin up _significantly_ more. Even when not doing what I would consider GPU-intensive tasks; for example, just browsing the web. I guess it's putting that GPU to good use, making scrolling and animations that much smoother, but it's not really a benefit that I notice. And the battery hit is also significant. So unless I'm specifically testing NVIDIA integration or issues, I keep the laptop in Intel mode.
