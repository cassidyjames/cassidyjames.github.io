**NOTE: This is a fictitious blog post! This is how I think through problems and potential solutions. If you somehow come across this draft (üëãÔ∏è), know that it's a peek into my brain and _a potential_ approach I personally think could be taken‚Äînothing more!**
</aside>

If you've been following GNOME development over the past few years you may be familiar with discussions around accent colors. Specifically, can GNOME support some nice user expression upstream while enabling downstream distributions to differentiate themselves‚Äîall while considering the wants and needs of the expanding app developer community?

I'm happy to report that we* now have a thorough proposal and prototype of how to solve this complex request. Before we get into implementation details, let's talk about the approaches we considered and how we arrived with this proposal.

<aside markdown="1">
*For the purposes of this post, "we" means myself, [Alex](https://blogs.gnome.org/alexm/), [Chris](https://blogs.gnome.org/christopherdavis/), and [Jamie](https://itsjamie.dev/). While we're all currently working within the GNOME community, our work here was an independent effort after having been involved over the past several years in these discussions. We're proposing this to the broader GNOME community after a long process within the FreeDesktop space.
</aside>

When solving a complex design problem, **you have to consider the stakeholders.** Of course it's easy to think of yourself (or whatever group you're contributing to) as the sole stakeholder, but‚Äîespecially with a space as complicated as FreeDesktop‚Äîthere are several other parties involved.

When I contributed to designing the [FreeDesktop color scheme preference](https://cassidyjames.com/blog/the-need-for-a-freedesktop-dark-style-preference/) (enabling the system-wide dark style preference) I was initially concerned about elementary OS and its users, but also actively engaged GNOME contributors, app developers, and other FreeDesktop platforms to get their input and ensure the spec could work for them. The reality is that **this sort of feature only really works for users if it works for _most of their apps,_** not just the handful they use that were designed explicitly for their corner of the wider ecosystem. As a result, the FreeDesktop color scheme spec is implemented across elementary OS, KDE, GNOME, and their ecosystems‚Äîincluding major cross-platform apps like Firefox.

We're doing our best to take the same approach with accent colors.

## The Stakeholders

For accent colors, we've specifically identified the following stakeholders based on extensive discussions and experience in the space:

- Downstream distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora, Vanilla OS, etc.
- FreeDesktop platforms: GNOME, elementary OS/Pantheon, KDE, etc.
- App developers: those making apps for GNOME Circle, KDE, elementary AppCenter, and cross-desktop  
- End users: people using the thing!

**Downstream distributions** have expressed the want to brand their experience via the default look and feel. Some distros like Ubuntu have done this with a different system stylesheet since the very beginning, while others like Fedora take more of a light-touch approach with wallpapers and logos in spots provided by the GNOME desktop. Distributions see their role as being close to end users and providing an experience they believe those users will want, and will recognize when they see it across the room or on the big screen.

**FreeDesktop platforms** want to create what they believe is the best ecosystem of apps and desktop experience. This means shipping features their users want, but also cooperating in ensuring the different platforms remain interoperable with one another. We also have to consider accessibility and maintainability of the platforms as a whole, and how different features are used by different downstreams.

**App developers** want to design and make apps that look and work how they expect across supported platforms. They might want their app to look exactly the same across Ubuntu, elementary OS, and KDE, or they might want it to adapt to each platform in some way they define‚Äîbut either way, it should be easy to achieve.

**End users** want apps that work on their platform of choice, and if possible look and feel native‚Äîthough that's a secondary concern to the app being _usable_ in the first place. They also want their environment to look and feel like _their own,_ whether for aesthetic or accessibility concerns, e.g. by setting a wallpaper, a light or dark style, a font size, etc.

## Possible Accent Color Approaches

When thinking through how we could approach this both from the GNOME side and as a more generic FreeDesktop spec, we came up with three potential approaches that _could_, in theory, work. Each has trade-offs.

### 1. Arbitrary Color

A naive approach would be to enable the system (e.g. a distributor or user) to define an arbitrary accent color, and then toolkits would be expected to just‚Ä¶ use that. This would theoretically provide the most flexibility for end users and distributions, but it falls apart.

From the Libadwaita side, we already support setting arbitrary accent colors _from the app developer side_, where the app developer is expected to design and test their app to work or provide custom CSS to expand upon that. However, there's no simple way the _system_ setting any potential arbitrary color would work for app developers, as it would mean developers can no longer use accent colors in interesting ways with guarantees of contrast and thus accessibility‚Äîplus Libadwaita requires a _set_ of colors for different contexts, not just a single base color.

Libadwaita would need to not just accept the color as-is, but perform some amount of complicated and ultimately subjective transforms on the color to derive an accent _palette_ that can _then_ be used by apps. This might sound feasible, but it really falls apart when the provided color is gray, yellow, brown, or any number of other shades of colors. An implementation would need to algorithmically perform subjective color science like hue-rotating certain colors in certain directions and other colors in other directions when used as shadows or highlights, determine contrasting colors for the various contexts accents are used like text-on-background or icons-on-views, and all in both light and dark style variants, etc. while ensuring the colors never look plain‚Ä¶ ugly. It's _very_ complex work and frankly seems like it would be extraordinarily over-engineered for a result that wouldn't even spit out the original color that was chosen in the first place.

Different toolkits would implement different color science, resulting in mismatched colors across apps as well‚Äîif you chose Ubuntu orange, for example, there's no guarantee that actual exact color would even appear _anywhere_ in the UI‚Äîbut some possible muddied or hue-shifted version could. It's not exactly on-brand in that way.

### 2. (or 1b.) Nearest Accent

A different solution to the first approach would be to define the spec as _accepting_ an arbitrary color, but then letting the toolkit (or in this case, Libadwaita) algorithmically choose the "nearest" accent color from its existing palette. This approach could offer toolkits the most flexibility (as they'd need to only support a limited number of known colors), but it could have the same sort of end result problem as the first option. It would be up to the individual platforms to decide how to expose this to users, whether they expose a full color picker, or just some predefined values.

An issue we could see is that color palettes between platforms differ, for example. If someone chooses a nice deep teal color for their accent, it might map to elementary's lighter "Mint" accent color or even GNOME's (slightly blue-leaning) green color. A Libadwaita app would use one color while an app using the Ubuntu stylesheet might map to any of four different green-ish accent options.

There's potential for unpredictability and inconsistency, though it's not quite as complex as the first approach.

### 3. Named Colors

The last approach continues the line of thinking from the previous two: if you can't perform a bunch of color science on an arbitrary color, and it's not ideal to map an arbitrary color to a set of potential accent colors, what if you remove the arbitrary part, and make it more-well-defined? That's what Named Colors attempts to solve.

In this approach, the spec would define a set of named colors, like "red," "orange, "yellow," etc. that platforms could commit to supporting. The exact values of these colors are intentionally not defined in the spec, enabling the toolkit to take that color and present something from its own palette that fits. Like the nearest accent approach, it eases the burden a bit from implementors as they would only need to test against a defined set of colors, and it allows for expression in each toolkit or stylesheet's own interpretation of a color. It also codifies setting user expectations of not necessarily picking "I want this exact shade of blurple," but more, "I chose the 'green' option, so apps are using green accents!"

We do have a great starting point for colors that's been shipping to users for years: elementary OS! They have defined their own branded versions of red, orange, yellow, green, mint, blue, purple, pink, brown, and slate (a chromatic gray). These ten colors seem like an excellent jumping off point and could be adopted as Named Colors in the FreeDesktop spec. This would give a clear migration path for elementary OS, covers the spectrum of GNOME accent colors, and nearly matches the options in KDE today. Ubuntu specifically would likely need to change or remove a single accent color option they're shipping today.

The risks of this approach center around agreeing on that set of named colors in the first place‚Äîfor example, Ubuntu currently ships accent color options that don't neatly fit into a generic color spectrum, with several different shades of green. Some desktops that want to offer arbitrary colors might feel limited by this implementation, and you could _still_ have inconsistency where different toolkits interpret named colors in ways unexpected by the user. There are also open questions around appending the spec with new colors.

## Proposal

<aside markdown="1">
**NOTE: All screenshots in this post are work-in-progress prototypes!** There may be issues and unsolved problems in them, so please don't assume they represent a finished product.
</aside>

Named Colors was our preferred approach initially, as it seemed to be the least-bad and least complex option for GNOME and elementary OS. However, it didn't really align with the direction for KDE, COSMIC, or tauOS contributors who were [proposing the FreeDesktop portal implementation](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/815) in the first place.

Given the above‚Äîand after a years-long process with multiple hours-long discussions and hundreds of comments from across the ecosystem‚Äîwe have decided to back **Arbitrary Color for the FreeDesktop spec**, proposed to be implemented as **Nearest Accent for GNOME/Libadwaita**. While a bit more complex for GNOME to implement than strict Named Colors, it does seem to offer a balance of flexibility for platforms, distribution differentiation, predictability and testability for GNOME-targeting app devs, and lower implementation complexity for GNOME than complete Arbitrary Colors‚Äîall while still enabling a lot of end user expression.

Given an arbitrary color, platforms (e.g. via the toolkit or a platform library) would need to derive their palette that can be used by that platform's apps. The exact implementation is up to each platform, but essentially if the FreeDesktop Portal says the accent color is `#f00`, platforms should take that and decide how to use it in a way that makes sense for them.

<figure markdown="1">

<figcaption markdown="1">

</figcaption>
</figure>

For GNOME, we envision mapping it to the nearest accent color‚Äîperhaps including some additions inspired from the elementary palette, like pink and slate; so if the portal says `#f00`, we'd match that to our existing red palette. elementary OS could do something similar by having Granite automatically set the closest-matching stylesheet variant, similar to how they handle wallpaper-based accent colors today. In KDE (please excuse my limited knowledge of the inner workings!), I believe the chosen color could be given directly to QPalette. On Ubuntu, GNOME apps could map to the nearest palette color; the palette could be defined in the Yaru stylesheet as it is today. Flutter apps could potentially use an accent color directly e.g. to seed its Material Design 3 support.

In the future, if some sufficiently talented and motivated developer wanted to try to add arbitrary color support to GNOME in a way that ensures both accessibility and aesthetic quality, that _could theoretically_ be possible‚Äîor it could even be implemented as a third-party library on top of GTK; the FreeDesktop spec wouldn't limit how the accent color could be used down the road.

## GNOME Design Considerations

Let's get into GNOME and Libadwaita specifics; if you were just here for the FreeDesktop stuff, that's a wrap, and thanks for reading!

First, we want to be clear: even though the FreeDesktop portal might accept and store arbitrary values, we see that as an implementation detail on GNOME desktop‚Äî**we propose that the set of well-defined choices be exposed in Appearance Settings in a way similar to how elementary OS and Ubuntu display them today.**

While thinking through this proposal for GNOME, some of the other biggest considerations were:

- Not adding an undue burden for app developers
- How to ensure we retain semantic color (e.g. for destructive actions or warnings)
- How it looks across the platform, e.g. in places like suggested actions in dialogs
- How we would implement it in Shell
- How downstream distributors could use this for differentiation

### App Developers

For app developers, an important thing to remember is that they're always in control of how their app works. While Libadwaita could support FreeDesktop accent colors by default, a developer can always override the accent color used by their app, as they see fit for their design and brand‚Äîjust like today with the default blue accent color. 

<figure markdown="1">
![Calendar with red accent](/images/blog/accent-colors/cal-red.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">
Calendar with a prototype red accent color
</figcaption>
</figure>

This is identical to how the FreeDesktop color scheme preference was implemented in Libadwaita for the dark style. If a developer wants to support accent colors, they would need to test with the colors in the GNOME palette‚Äîbut by following best practices around color usage, they can be fairly confident the palette will just work for them by default.

### Semantic Color

While color should never be used as the _only_ or way to understand context (due to color blindness, inaccurate displays, and even Night Light altering visible colors), color can be used effectively to enhance the semantics of the desktop. However, this is a challenge when colors like red and yellow exist in the set of potential accent colors in addition to being used semantically for things like "destructive" or "warning."

<figure class="half" markdown="1">

![Clocks with red accent](/images/blog/accent-colors/clocks-red.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">

</figcaption>
</figure>

elementary OS alleviates this by using a lighter tint style for accent-colored buttons, while using a more aggressively-contrasty red style for destructive actions. We actually came to align on the opposite approach: use the selected accent color similarly to how the blue accent is used in GNOME today, but tone down and differentiate destructive actions. This is actually [recommended by UX Movement](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-to-design-destructive-actions-that-prevent-data-loss/) precisely to avoid mistaking destructive actions as the suggested call to action‚Äîand it works well here, too.

<figure class="half" markdown="1">

![Calendar with slate accent](/images/blog/accent-colors/cal-slate.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">

</figcaption>
</figure>

Something nice about a chromatic gray "slate" accent color is that it can reduce the amount of bright, potentially-distracting accent colors throughout the OS while retaining their semantic meaning‚Äîbeing different and distinct from non-accent buttons, labels, icons, etc. This accent color would also make other semantic colors like destructive actions stand out even more, which could be seen as an accessibility boon.

### Dialogs

For suggested actions in dialogs specifically, we had a different problem: the accent-colored text of red, pink, and orange could be very similar to the destructive red text, making it unclear which is the suggested and which is the destructive action. We could just make the suggestion action an accent background, but we did this in Adwaita for GTK3 and didn't love it‚Äîit makes the dialog feel very unbalanced and overly aggressive.

<figure class="half" markdown="1">
![Dialog with pink accent color text](/images/blog/accent-colors/dialog-pink.png)
![Dialog with pink accent color background](/images/blog/accent-colors/dialog-pink-bg.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">
**Left:** Accent-colored text | **Right:** Accent-colored background
</figcaption>
</figure>

We considered making the suggested action just _a bit_ more prominent‚Äîusing an elementary-like tint in this context‚Äîwhile keeping the destructive action more toned down. This is what we currently do for the hover styles, so we'd need to adapt those a bit, too. 

<figure markdown="1">
![Dialog with tinted suggested action button](/images/blog/accent-colors/dialog-hover.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">

</figcaption>
</figure>

However, this still didn't feel right with colors close to the destructive style because it matches the new proposed destructive style elsewhere, leading to potential confusion.

</video> 

While thinking it through and playing with different styles, we thought: what if we simplify the styling in dialogs a bit, keeping the general layout, but treating buttons more similarly to everywhere else?

<figure class="half" markdown="1">
![Dialog with unstyled buttons](/images/blog/accent-colors/dialog-unstyled.png)
![Dialog with vertical unstyled buttons](/images/blog/accent-colors/dialog-vertical.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">

</figcaption>
</figure>

Once we started playing with this, it just felt right. It feels a bit simpler and more modern than the old GTK3 styles or the current GTK4 styles while not fundamentally changing the layout.

### Shell

Shell uses its own toolkit, st, rather than GTK. As such, we're working on an implementation of accent colors there, as well.

<figure class="third" markdown="1">
![Shell with a purple accent](/images/blog/accent-colors/shell-purple.png)

![Shell with a teal accent](/images/blog/accent-colors/shell-teal.png)
<figcaption markdown="1">

</figure>

This was actually easier than we expected it to be when we set out, and we think the results are nice!

### Downstream Distribution Examples

As a fun sort of exercise, I wanted to see if‚Äîtheoretically‚Äîthe proposed accent colors plus the existing color scheme preference could be a tool distributions use for differentiation. Using a very early prototype of accent colors in Libadwaita, see if you can identify each distro by a screenshot of its theoretical default settings:

![Orange light](/images/blog/accent-colors/orange-light.png)

![Cyan dark](/images/blog/accent-colors/cyan-dark.png)

![Blue light](/images/blog/accent-colors/blue-light.png)

![Green dark](/images/blog/accent-colors/green-dark.png)

![Yellow light](/images/blog/accent-colors/yellow-light.png)

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">

**Top to bottom:** Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Fedora, Manjaro, Vanilla OS
</details>

Did you get them all? Okay, perhaps that was too easy with the wallpapers, fonts, Shell extensions, etc‚Ä¶ but that is kind of the point! I personally would love to see distributions using well-defined preferences for their differentiation while not resorting to the nuclear option of changing the entire system stylesheet out from under third-party apps. Using the accent color instead helps ensure apps can feel more at home across distributions right out of the box while also being predictable for the app developers.

### Open Questions

That just about wraps this up, but just for completeness-sake, we wanted to let you know that we do have some remaining questions that will need to be solved.

There are places in the Shell styling that use images‚Äîlike checks and switches‚Äîthat will either need to be ported to CSS, or (as a last resort) we'll need to provide colored SVGs in all the accent colors.

GNOME currently has (very nice!) blue folder icons, visible in GNOME Files and the file picker. With a user-selected accent color, would we _want_ those to follow along? Does that create a lot more work for maintaining the icon set? Is it fine if the folders are always GNOME-blue, regardless of the accent color? This is something we need to think about and discuss with the design team and icon maintainers.

The actual accent color palettes for each of the ten colors needs to be chosen, and along with that, we should probably have internal guidelines/metrics for contrast and accessibility. E.g. we need to ensure yellow is as accessible as blue, and have a measure of how we know that.

Lastly, there's still more thought and discussion needed around semantic colors and how to ensure e.g. destructive and error states are visually distinct when using accent colors.

### Prototype Progress

There's [an open PR against the FreeDesktop portal](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/815) we were involved in to add the tiny amount of support‚Äîand importantly, specification‚Äîneeded for accent colors. We've also opened [an MR against the GNOME desktop schemas](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gsettings-desktop-schemas/-/merge_requests/63/diffs) which will be required to support accent colors. We've proposed updates to [destructive styles](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita/-/merge_requests/810) and [message dialog styles](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita/-/merge_requests/812) in LibAdwaita which would address the considerations raised above. We've also opened a [draft merge request against GNOME Shell](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/merge_requests/2715) for accent color support there, as well.

Finally, we're working on a prototype of the behavior in Libadwaita to map RGB values to the appropriate accent colors, and apply them to the app. After that, we can propose the required changes to the Appearance panel in GNOME Settings to bring it all together.

I know that was a _monster_ of a blog post, so props for getting through it to the end. We hope this proposal makes sense and serves as a kicking-off point for a long-awaited way for users to make their desktop their own, distributions to differentiate themselves in well-defined ways, and app developers to not be overwhelmed with the implementation. üòÖÔ∏è Thanks to Alex, Chris, and Jamie for their collaboration, and for future related posts, be sure to follow [my blog](https://cassidyjames.com/blog), [Alex's blog](https://blogs.gnome.org/alexm/), and [Chris' blog](https://blogs.gnome.org/christopherdavis/)‚Äîor just subscribe to [GNOME Planet](https://planet.gnome.org/) to get it all!
