title: "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for PS5 is Unacceptable"
description: Frustrating glitches and lack of quality control shouldn’t get a free pass

I have been playing _Star Wars: Jedi Survivor_ on PS5 for the past several weeks, and it has been such a _frustrating_ experience. You’ve probably heard (and I would agree!) that the latest blockbuster game in the Star Wars franchise ticks all the boxes for a AAA studio:

- Great story
- Believable and nuanced acting, animation, and character design
- Breathtaking environment design
- Overall good game-play*
- New mechanics/game-play features to mix things up
- An extremely STAR WARS vibe

<small markdown="1">_*Improved from the first game in the series, but still frustrating at times_</small>

But somehow, there is nary a mention of the defining aspect of how I experience this game:

## Extremely glitchy, persistent graphical and performance issues

Every single time I play _Jedi: Survivor_, I see:

- bright flashing white polygons when moving the camera
- textures failing to load
- environmental details popping in a meter away from the character
- broken HDR resulting in everything suddenly getting extremely dark
- flashing, headache-inducing lighting glitches
- wildly inconsistent frame rates
- constantly out-of-sync dialog

Honestly, it’s the worst quality gaming experience I’ve had since… well, _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_. It breaks my suspension of disbelief every time; I’m constantly reminded that this is a poorly-optimized, over-rushed game put out by a publisher who couldn’t be bothered with quality control.

## Is it just me?

The state of _Jedi: Survivor_ a year in is especially frustrating to me because **I had the same experience with _Jedi: Fallen Order_ on PS4**, and in both cases according to Reddit, I’m crazy; anyone taking to forums to complain or ask if this is normal is told the game is _fine_ or that it was all fixed in some post-release update—it’s the most hardcore fan gaslighting I’ve ever seen.

When I got _Jedi: Fallen Order_ over a year after release, I was appealed by how poorly the game played on PS4. I assumed at the time the game was designed for PS4 Pro and just didn’t work as well on my PS4, but it looks like that’s just how this series is made. The quality standards aren’t just low, they’re subterranean.

Perhaps I am just used to well-made PlayStation games like Horizon, Uncharted, The Last of Us, Spider-Man, Ratchet & Clank… basically all of my favorites? Each game in those series plays beautifully without _any_ of the issues I see here—and they are no slouch when it comes to graphical fidelity, environment size, lighting, and character detail.

I’m happy I got _Jedi: Survivor_ as a gift (and I know it was purchased during a good sale!), but sheesh. You’d think a year after release and [eight patches later](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes) it would not be this rough. And Reddit tells me “oh yeah they fixed that all with the update” which came out before I even started playing the game—I can assure you, if this is “fixed,” the game was _completely_ broken before.

## “Just change these settings to get it to play acceptably!”

A common, recurring suggestion across the Internet is to dig into the game’s massive list of settings and fiddle until it’s playable. I’ve indeed tried both graphical modes (“Quality” and “Performance”), turning off a bunch of graphical features (film grain, motion blur, chromatic aberration), tweaking or completely disabling HDR, installing the game to the PS5's on-board storage vs. expansion storage…

But you know what? I prefer game consoles because **I shouldn’t have to fiddle with all of that**—and it doesn’t fix it, anyway! All the while, extremely beautiful, taxing games play perfectly fine out of the box—as they should.

## Something something game journalism

I have not seen a single news publication or game reviewer call these issues out to the degree that is deserved. Reviews either don’t mention graphical or performance issues _at all_, brush them off as minor and inconsequential, or just mention it’s a pre-launch version. [Den of Geek's pre-release feature](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor-bugs-performance-issues/) is the most critical I've read, aggregating issues shared by other outlets before release—but most reviews don’t do it justice.

Of note: reviews were clearly embargoed to the 11th hour, **coordinated to drop no sooner than one day before release** (to maximize the pre-order window before reviews came out).

#### The Kotaku Review

There’s stuff piled on top of stuff, and not all of it feels substantial, fully baked, or in some cases functional.
</aside>

In [Kotaku's lengthy but score-less review][Kotaku], they mention some issues but again, hedge that they’re a non-issue because of course they’ll be fixed in updates:

>It’s important to note I was playing a review build of the game ahead of a day-one patch, and I imagine whatever problems that persist after that will eventually be smoothed over as well. Nevertheless, throughout my time with the PlayStation 5 version I experienced a routinely unstable frame rate, multiple crashes, and occasional glitchy tomfoolery (mostly the fun kind). I’ve heard each version has its own set of performance woes, but you’ll have to seek out individual perspectives on that front. Overall though, after fiddling with my TV and settling the game to favor a solid 30fps over an unstable 60fps, things were fine far more often than not.

### Gamespot

<aside class="card" markdown="1">
#### **8/10** Great

Technical issues, especially on PS5 and PC, detract from the game's presentation
</aside>

A single paragraph towards the end of [Gamespot’s **8/10 (Great)** review][Gamespot] mentions issues:

>Survivor's technical performance is a stumbling block that must be noted. Playing on Xbox Series X, I experienced random crashes on a number of occasions… On PlayStation 5, a colleague reported some occasional stuttering, screen-tearing, and crashing too, and the PC version also has a variety of technical issues relating to in-game presentation, performance, and hardware optimization.

### Push Square

<aside class="card" markdown="1">
#### **9/10** Excellent

Minor frame rate issues; Inconsistent visuals
</aside>

[Push Square’s **9/10 (Excellent)** review][Push Square] claims there were issues before the day-0 patch, but that patch _totally fixed everything!_

>Prior to a Day 0 patch, the game was suffering from severe frame rate drops and terrible screen tearing. While we appreciated the experience so much, it was impossible to look past what was an unacceptable launch state. However, version 1.02 has saved _Star Wars Jedi: Survivor_ at the final hour.

Later on, they briefly mention some issues, but fail to expand on it:

>The visuals aren't [top quality], though. They're actually fairly inconsistent: a lot of cutscenes look outstanding but the moment-to-moment gameplay most certainly doesn't.

### VGC

<aside class="card" markdown="1">
#### **5/5** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The performance issues we encountered were disappointing
</aside>

The issues are mentioned in [VGC’s **5/5-star** review][VGC], though they’re explicitly hand-waved away for the final, perfect score:

>Unfortunately, we encountered some technical issues during our time with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. It should be noted that we completed the game before we had access to the day-one patch, which may or may not improve the issues we faced.
>
In the game’s open area, the frame rate, even in the game’s performance mode, was worryingly inconsistent. Screen tearing was a regular occurrence, and level of detail pop-in was a regular issue. The game also seemed to struggle to load in certain areas… and its large open play space seem to be the issue…
>
The performance issues we encountered were disappointing but didn’t dampen the excitement of exploring the galaxy with some of the best characters of the Disney era.

#### **8.9/** Must-Play

[DualShocker’s **8.9/10** review][DualShockers]

>The successes here are marred a bit by the uneven performance issues present in all versions of the game, but especially the PC version. I played through on the PS5, and while I can confidently recommend this game for all the incredible things it does well, there’s no denying that the game will simply be in a better place after a few months of polish and bug fixes. My playthrough was, I’m fortunate to say, fairly bug-free, though the performance dips in places were noticeable. I can’t say they’ve hampered my enjoyment, all things considered, but they are noticeable and disappointing.
>
>Even with the frame rate dips, occasional fuzzy textures, and uneven pacing, this game is a phenomenal sequel, a fantastic Star Wars game, and just a straight-up great game. This is currently my favorite Star Wars game, hands down. Between the stellar writing, exploration, traversal, and combat, Survivor offers a powerful experience, and one well worth having. Whether you want to wait a bit for a few more patches or you just want to jump in now, this game is worth your time.

### Screen Rant

<aside class="card" markdown="1">
#### **4.5/5** Must-Play

Screen Rant was provided with a PS5 digital download code for the purpose of this review.
</aside>

Curiously, if you search [Screen Rant's **4.5/5 (Must-Play)** review][Screen Rant], you won’t find a single mention of the words: performance; frame rate; graphics; lighting; HDR; issue; crash; glitch; bug. They don't even touch on _how the game looks or performs_, even though they were playing the same buggy, crash-prone pre-release PS5 build as everyone else. Instead, they say:

>For players willing to approach the game on its terms, Survivor has a lot to offer, and it should be considered among the upper echelon of Star Wars video games… Those who enjoyed Fallen Order will likely be enamored by Survivor. It takes the often rough foundation delineated by its predecessor, smooths some of the rougher edges, and builds it into a much more expansive experience that tells a more complex tale.

### The Guardian

Similar to Screen Rant, [The Guardian’s **5/5-star** review][The Guardian] has literally nothing to say about the performance, graphics, or any issues whatsoever—even though they played the notably buggy PS5 version before release. From their review, you would think it’s the most flawless game ever produced:

>The best Star Wars game in 20 years
>
>Respawn Entertainment’s sequel is a huge improvement over Jedi: Fallen Order, and a virtual blockbuster without compromise
>
>…the game’s tactile controls and precisely balanced challenge make it consistently rewarding. Meanwhile, its biggest moments rival anything games like God of War or Elden Ring can throw at you. Be assured, this is the Star Wars game you’re looking for.
