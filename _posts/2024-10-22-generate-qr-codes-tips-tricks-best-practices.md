I feel like I'm always telling people how QR codes should be used "properly," so I'm writing it all down in one place as a short blog post in hopes that it helps with discoverabilityâ€”and I can just send this link instead of repeating myself!

- Don't use a "service" or third-party URL shortener
- Use redirects yourself if you need to
- Omit www. and extra characters if your site allows it
- integrating a logo can be done, but it's best to avoid it
- Keep high contrast, but it doesn't _have_ to be black-on-white
