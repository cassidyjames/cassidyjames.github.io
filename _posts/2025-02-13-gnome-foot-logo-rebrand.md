title: GNOME Should Kick the Foot to the Curb… Mostly

This past week volunteers working with the GNOME design and engagement teams debuted a brand new [GNOME.org](https://gnome.org) website—one that was met largely with one of two reactions:

1. **It's beautiful and modern, nice work!** and

2. **What have you done with the foot? You have ruined GNOME!**

You see, the site doesn't feature the GNOME logo at the top of the page—it just has the word **GNOME**, with the actual logo relegated to the footer. It's pretty safe to say (from my own observations, at least) that the second reaction was _mostly_ the sentiment of a handful of long-time contributors who had grown very cozy with the current GNOME logo:

![GNOME Logo, which is a foot (dark version)](/images/blog/gnome-foot-logo-rebrand/foot-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only){: .card }

### What's the problem?

It's a four-toed foot that is sort of supposed to look like a letter G. According to legend (read: my conversations with designers and contributors who have been working with GNOME for more years than I have fingers _and_ toes), the logo is basically a story of happenstance: an early wallpaper featured footprints in the sand, that was modified into an icon for the menu, that was turned into a sort of logo while being modified to look like the letter G, and then that version was cleaned up a bit and successfully trademarked by the GNOME Foundation.

If I'm being honest, it's not a particularly good _logo:_ it doesn't convey anything about the project (which by itself is fine… many logos don't directly!), it's an awkward shape that doesn't fit cleanly into a square or circle, especially at smaller sizes (e.g. for a social media avatar or favicon), and—I'll be completely honest—way too many people have turned their nose up at the weird foot sticker on my laptop. It doesn't exactly set a great first impression for a community and modern computing platform.

But… it's cozy! Folks who have been around in the community for longer than me have clearly gotten used to the foot, and appreciate it for being goofy, whimsical, and unserious. It has some amount of brand recognition, at least within the open source space.

### So what can we do?

While there are some folks that would push for a _complete_ rebrand of GNOME—name included, I feel like there's a softer approach we could take to the issue. In some ways, it has been an unspoken natural phenomenon as members of the GNOME design team have soured a bit on trying to make designs look nice while accommodating a funky four-toed G-ish foot.

I propose that we:

1. **Phase the foot out from user-facing spaces** since it's hard to work with in all of the contexts we need to use a logo, and it's not particularly attractive to new users or contributors—something we need to keep in mind as an aging open source project. We've started to see less prominent usage of the foot anyway, e.g. on [release notes](https://release.gnome.org), the [new website](https://gnome.org), [GNOME Circle](https://circle.gnome.org), [This Week in GNOME](https://thisweek.gnome.org), [GNOME Handbook](https://handbook.gnome.org), and in other spaces where contributors aren't the most fond of it.

2. **Continue to modernize the GNOME brand** by leaning into our use of color, animation, illustrations, and recurring motifs (like the amazing wallpapers from Jakub!). Again this is something that has sort of started happening naturally, e.g. with the web team's newer web designs and as the design team made the decision to move to Inter-based Adwaita Sans for the user interface. And this push continues to receive positive feedback—it's just not yet officially reflected as well as it could be in the brand guidelines.

3. **Immortalize the foot as a mascot**, something to be used as an easter egg, in developer documentation, and in contributor-facing spaces. It's a bit easier to tell newcomers, "oh this is a fun icon that used to be our logo—we love it, even if it's kind of goofy" without it having to represent our entire brand from the outside. It remains a symbol for the contributor community while avoiding it necessarily representing the _entire GNOME brand._

4. **Commission a new logo** to represent GNOME to the outside world; this would be the logo you'd expect to see at GNOME.org, on user-facing social media profiles, on event banners, etc. We've been mulling ideas over in the design team for literal years at this point, but it's been difficult to pursue anything seriously without attracting very loud negative feedback from a handful of folks—perhaps if it is part of a longer-term plan explicitly including the above steps, it could be something we'd be able to pursue. **And it could still be something quirky, cute, and whimsical!** I personally don't love the idea of something as generic as a circle as a logo—I think something that connects to "GNOME" or our history would be great here.

5. **Stretch goal: title-case Gnome as a brand name**. We've long moved past GNOME being an acronym (GNU Network Object Model Environment?)—with a bit of a soft rebrand, I feel we could officially say that it's spelled "Gnome," especially if done so in an official logotype. As we know, much like the pronunciation of GNOME itself, folks will do what they want—and they're free to!—but this would be more about how the brand name is used in an official capacity. I don't feel super strongly about this one, but it _is_ awkward to have to explain why it's all-caps, why it's called GNOME, and why the logo is a foot any time I tell someone what I contribute to. ;)

### What do you think?

I promise I'm not trying to start flame wars here; I genuinely think GNOME as a project and community is in a good place to move forward with modernizing our image a bit. Members of the design team like Jamie, kramo, Jakub, Tobias, Sam, and Allan and contributors across the project like Alice, Sophie, and probably half a dozen more I am forgetting have been working hard at modernizing our UI and image when it comes to software—I think it's time we caught up with the brand itself.

Hit me up on Mastodon or any of the links in the footer to tell me if you think I'm right, or if I've gotten this all terribly wrong. :)
