Moving away from Google Chrome was _probably_ the easiest migration in my [de-Googling efforts](/blog/de-googling). I'm not a huge user of bookmarks or extensions, so those weren't tying me down. On the desktop, I just switched to a combination of [Ephemeral](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral/) (as my defaut), Epiphany (as my main "real browser"), and Firefox (for when something doesn't work right in Epiphany). Since Epiphany supports Firefox Sync, it's actually pretty easy to jump between the two as needed. I do have Chromium installed for testing web development in a Chrome-based engine, but I don't use it for any real browsing.

Ephemeral is a lightweight privacy browser that I develop for elementary OS, so of course I dogfood it and have it set as the default. A key feature is that you can pop sites open in your "real" browser with one click, so I usually have that set to Epiphanyâ€”a native GTK browser that comes with elementary OS, so it's an obvious choice. However, some sites don't perform well in it, so I do keep Firefox around for that. And Firefox on the desktop has gotten really good.

For a long time, Chrome was the only browser I liked on Android, though. Others either felt non-native due to scrolling physics (like Firefox was), had questionable monetization incentives, or had too many features I didn't care about. However, Firefox on Android has come leaps and bounds in the last several months, and an even better, entirely rebuilt version is coming this spring. I've switched to it full-time on my phone and have not looked back. Plus, sync with desktop Firefox (and Epiphany!) makes it all work well together.
