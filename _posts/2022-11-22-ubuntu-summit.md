Earlier this month, Georges and I attended the first-ever [Ubuntu Summit](https://events.canonical.com/event/2/) in Prague, Czechia along with hundreds of other members of the open source community. A decade since the last Ubuntu Developer Summit, Canonical hosted this refreshed Ubuntu Summit with the following introduction:

>An opportunity for the broader Ubuntu community to learn and speak about the amazing work and success stories happening in the ecosystem. We want to enable a wide and diverse group to connect, collaborate, and lower the barriers between what they do best and how Ubuntu can help achieve that.
>
>Let's celebrate the spirit of Ubuntu — I am what I am because of who we all are.

Endless OS is the Linux-based operating system from the Endless OS Foundation—built on a Debian base with the Ubuntu kernel—and members of the Endless OS Foundation are core contributors to the GNOME desktop environment, which is in turn used by the Ubuntu desktop. As such, it made sense for us to attend to learn from, collaborate within, and network with the rest of the Ubuntu community.

## Presenting

Georges and I each presented at the summit; I gave a talk while Georges co-hosted a GNOME panel.

## Talks

The summit was designed around talks, panels, and workshops as the primary scheduled material with various social events in the evenings. Between the two of us, Georges and I attended the following talks:

### Non-code contributions welcome! How non-coders can contribute to open source projects _Michelangelo Guarise_
