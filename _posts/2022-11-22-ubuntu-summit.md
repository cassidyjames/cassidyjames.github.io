Earlier this month, Georges and I attended the first-ever [Ubuntu Summit](https://events.canonical.com/event/2/) in Prague, Czechia along with hundreds of other members of the open source community. A decade since the last Ubuntu Developer Summit, Canonical hosted this refreshed Ubuntu Summit with the following introduction:

>An opportunity for the broader Ubuntu community to learn and speak about the amazing work and success stories happening in the ecosystem. We want to enable a wide and diverse group to connect, collaborate, and lower the barriers between what they do best and how Ubuntu can help achieve that.
>
>Let's celebrate the spirit of Ubuntu — I am what I am because of who we all are.

Endless OS is the Linux-based operating system from the Endless OS Foundation—built on a Debian base with the Ubuntu kernel—and members of the Endless OS Foundation are core contributors to the GNOME desktop environment, which is in turn used by the Ubuntu desktop. As such, it made sense for us to attend to learn from, collaborate within, and network with the rest of the Ubuntu community.

## Presenting

Georges and I each presented at the summit; I gave a talk about app store listings while Georges co-hosted a GNOME panel.

### [How to Make a Delightful App Listing _Cassidy_](https://events.canonical.com/event/2/contributions/4/)

Over the years I’ve helped build an app ecosystem built on open standards, and now at the Endless OS Foundation I work with organizations around the world deploying computers that run on Linux and open source technologies to dozens, hundreds, or thousands of people at a time.

One of the recurring places I’ve noticed app developers struggling is their app’s metainfo—the structured data that essentially forms an app’s marketing page across all the app stores including Ubuntu Software, GNOME Software, KDE Discover, elementary AppCenter, and more.

Over all I feel like my talk was well-received, and I was thrilled to get a handful of great, relevant questions from the audience!
