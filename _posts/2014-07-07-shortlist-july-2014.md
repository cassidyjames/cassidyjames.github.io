I hate wishlists. Making a big long list of all the things you want just seems both tedious and selfish for some reason. I get that some people might want to get you gifts for your birthday or Christmas or some random occasion. But by making a wishlist, I feel like I'm saying, "Get me anything as long as it's on this big long list."

Instead, I've come up with the idea of keeping a personal shortlist. What's the difference? It's a list of a few things (I still haven't decided on a cap, but definitely ten or fewer) I _really_ want. Not just, "Oh this looks nice, add it to the list." But like, _the things_ I'd like to get for myself if/when I can afford it. If someone really wants to get an awesome gift from my shortlist, I will absolutely love it. Otherwise, they can use that list as inspiration for other things I'd like. Or they can give me something more personal/handmade, and that's cool.

## Current Shortlist

  1. [Nest thermostat](https://store.nest.com/product/thermostat/)
  2. [Lockitron](https://lockitron.com/preorders/pick_color)
  3. [Destiny for PS4](http://us.playstation.com/ps4/games/destiny-ps4.html)
  4. [Moto 360](https://moto360.motorola.com/)

Right now, it's at four items. It could grow to five or six, but these are _the top things_ I'm currently in love with but don't own. :)

You may notice the top two items are decidedly grown-up; Katie and I are now married and living in our own apartment, so I have an excuse to use these smart home gadgets. :D
