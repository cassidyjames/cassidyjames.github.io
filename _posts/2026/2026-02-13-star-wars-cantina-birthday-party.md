Ever since my wife and I bought a house several years ago, I've wanted to throw a themed Star Wars party here. We've talked about doing a summer movie showing thing, we've talked about doing a Star Wars TV show marathon, and we've done a few birthday parties—but never the _full-on_ themed party that I was dreaming up. Until this year!

For some reason, a combination of rearranging some of our furniture, the state of my smart home, my enjoyment of _Star Wars: Outlaws_, and my newfound work/life balance meant that this was the year I finally committed to doing _the party._

### The Pitch

For the past few years I've thrown a two-part birthday party: we start out at a nearby bar or restaurant, and then head to the house for more drinks and games. I like this format as it gives folks a natural "out" if they don't want to commit to the entire evening: they can just join the beginning and then head out, or they can just meet up at our house. I was planning to do the same this year, but decided: let's go all-in at the house so we have more time for more fun. I knew I wanted:

1. **Trivia!** I organized a fun little Star Wars trivia game for my birthday last year and really enjoyed how nerdy my friends were with it, so this year I wanted to do something similar. My good friend Dagan volunteered to put together a fresh trivia game, which was incredible.

2. **Sabacc**. The Star Wars equivalent to poker, featured heavily in the _Star Wars: Outlaws_ game as well as in _Star Wars: Rebels_, _Solo: A Star Wars Story_, and the Disney Galactic Starcruiser (though it's Kessel Sabacc vs. traditional Sabacc vs. Corellian Spike vs. Coruscant Shift respectively… but I digress). I got a Kessel Sabacc set for Christmas and have wanted to play it with a group of friends ever since.

3. **Themed drinks**. Revnog is mentioned in Star Wars media including _Andor_ as some sort of liquor, and Spotchka is featured in the New Republic era shows like _The Mandalorian_ and _The Book of Boba Fett_. There isn't really any detail as to what each tastes like, but I knew I wanted to make some batch cocktails inspired by these in-universe drinks. 

4. **Immersive environment**. This meant smart lights, music, and some other aesthetic touches. Luckily over the years I've upgraded my smart home to feature nearly all locally-controllable RGB smart bulbs and fixtures; while during the day they simply shift from warm white to daylight and back, it means I can do _a lot_ with them for special occasions. I also have networked speakers throughout the house, and a 3D printer.

About a month before the party, I got to work.

### Nailing the Aesthetic

- Star Wars: Outlaws
- Black, white, and cyan
- Noise textre
- Crown Type fonts (Spectre, Womprat Aurebesh)
- Offset Aurebesh
- Inter font

### Website

<aside class="card" markdown="1">
I think more people should use subdomains for things like this! It's become a meme at this point that people buy domains for projects they never get around to, but I always have to remind people: subdomains are free. Focus on making the thing, put it up on a subdomain, and then if you ever spin it out into its own successful thing, _then_ you can buy a flashy bare domain for it!

Since I already owned [blaede.family](https://blaede.family) where I host extended family wishlists, recipes, and a Mastodon server, I resisted the urge to purchase yet another domain and instead went with a subdomain. [cantina.blaede.family](https://cantina.blaede.family/) doesn't _quite_ stay totally immersive, but it worked well enough—especially for a presumably short-lived project like this.
