Hey,

I loathe the _experience_ of email. I have an unending, bottomless ocean of email. Inbox Zero is a myth that would require archiving everything and pretending none of it mattered, or spending more hours than there are in a day—every day—to tame things. I hate it.

I am enamored with the _idea_ of email. Decentralized technology is both the past and future of a healthy Internet. Our best technologies have been built this way, and the fact that email has persisted in the face of threats of centralized communication like Facebook, iMessage, Slack, etc. shows that it is an incredibly powerful force. More technology should be designed and built in this way—but I digress. I love it.

Best,<br />
Cassidy
