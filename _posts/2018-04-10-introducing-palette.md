This past weekend, I realized I was opening a web browser to do something a native app could do better: referencing and copy-pasting colors. I was inspired to build that native app, and after a weekend of hacking, Iâ€™m proud to introduce Palette.

We use a [set of bright and friendly colors](https://elementary.io/brand) in elementary OS. With Palette, you can easily access the entire set on your local device, plus copy any variation of each color to paste into your own projects.

## Get It

Palette is available on AppCenter for the suggested price of $4. As with all AppCenter apps, you can also choose to pay what you want to download it, including $0.

[Get it on AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.cassidyjames.palette){: .button }

And as with every AppCenter app, the source code of Palette is openly licensed and available for free on GitHub.

I'd love to know what you all think!
