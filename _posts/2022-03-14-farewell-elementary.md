Right off the bat, I didn't want to write this blog post; Dani and I agreed that we would write a public post on the elementary blog sharing some light details and wishing each other well, but she then publicly shared an extremely distorted version of the situation on Twitter. As a result, I feel the need to correct the record, and then importantly: move on.

Over the last decade, I've worked to help build elementary into what it is today: a world-class operating system lead by a team who is involved in and oftentimes driving the direction of the greater open source desktop space. In 2011 I founded elementary, LLC. so we could have a legal entity under which to do business, sign agreements, etc. I owned and ran the company for seven years, bearing the entirety of the legal responsibility and the majority of the administration and logistics. At the time of its founding, Dani and I both had jobs elsewhere and worked on building elementary as much as we could.

In 2014, I joined System76 full-time while continuing to work on elementary. In 2015 or 2016 we made the decision to hire Dani on full time. In 2018, we restructured the company side of elementary into elementary, Inc. with Dani and I as equal co-owners, and then in August of 2018 I left System76 to join full time as well.

Over the past several months it became clear we needed to reprioritize our company finances—in my view, we needed to invest directly into contracts for projects like AppCenter and an online account system to bring in increased revenue while staying firm in our open source, privacy-centric, and ethical funding beliefs. Each release since I joined elementary full time performed even better sales-wise than the last, until OS 6 and 6.1 which performed far worse than expected, likely in part due to the ongoing global pandemic—people were seemingly less likely to pay an optional amount to download an operating system when they could just get it for free.

Something that came up repeatedly was the possibility of one or both of us again taking a full-time position at another company to enable us to hire or contract for those projects—we would stay involved with day-to-day operations and guidance of the company much like we had done in the past, but with a day job elsewhere to free up some resources. Dani instead pushed for making cuts to our salaries and healthcare in order to hire for other positions like a developer advocate or marketing.

We had a big business development meeting in December to go over projects, prioritize finances, and discuss the budget—and we again discussed the possibility of taking jobs elsewhere while continuing to work on elementary. In January, we enacted some adjustments including cutting salaries and completely eliminating healthcare for employees and family members. We agreed to revisit the situation quarterly, with the next time set in April.

Soon after this decision, a perfect opportunity in open source and with existing friends and colleagues was shared with me, so I looked into it.

After confirming that would be an incredible fit while allowing me to continue my work on elementary, I made the hard decision to cut back my hours involved at elementary, eliminate my salary, and work elsewhere for my wage—at the same time, it was abundantly clear that I would remain involved in a capacity similar to that of when we started elementary. Dani and I agreed to this verbally on the phone, and all seemed well.

Unfortunately, I found out that Dani immediately called our CFO and discussed how to force me out of the company. I also later learned this was not the first time Dani had discussed the possibility of forcing me out, which was a bit of a shock to me. In a follow-up discussion, Dani claimed for the first time that she was disappointed with my “performance” over the last several months and that she no longer wanted to work with me in any capacity. She told me I needed to resign immediately, that I needed to take some time away from the elementary community I had helped build over the last decade, and that she would not discuss any sort of a transition of my projects or responsibilities until I signed a legal agreement to resign from the company.

This was all a shock. We set up a phone call to discuss further and she opened by saying she was angry but didn't want to just yell at me—then proceeded to yell at me for seven minutes straight. I tried to steer the conversation towards discussing some sort of transition plan and she immediately shut it down, telling me this was not a discussion and again repeating her desire for me to immediately resign. I suggested we take a break, cool off, and resume the conversation asynchronously which she agreed to.

Luckily everything at this point is recorded in text form. There was a bit of back and forth, Dani saying I need to resign, me reiterating that wasn't my intention without having a plan in place, and that I didn't think that was the best plan for the company itself. We seemed to get to a standstill here, and Dani stopped working without any contact for two weeks. In the meantime, I tried to continue working on elementary but it was difficult as much of my work required her sign-off. Still, I continued reporting my work daily and making good progress.

Dani eventually replied that she was discussing her legal options with her lawyer. She also raised the possibility of her resigning from the company. At this point, I didn't know what to expect so I retained a lawyer as well to protect myself. She replied that she was going to offer me half of the company’s cash on hand to buy my 50% of the shares; I told her I didn't believe that was a fair valuation of the company, but that I would need to run the offer by a lawyer and get their opinion. She responded that there was no room for negotiation and that was her final offer. Hardly an amicable discussion.

At this point, I want to be clear: it's not about the money; I don't need a buy-out, and I never even intended for that to be on the table. As we had repeatedly discussed, the plan was a return to how we ran things when I was working full-time elsewhere, with me still being very involved in the company and its success. However, Dani continued to push for that as her only offer. I discussed it with my lawyer and they agreed that it was not an accurate valuation of a company, especially when there is a strong brand identity, hundreds of thousands of users, and a reputation of design leadership in our industry. But if Dani was adamant about this being the only route, I decided it was probably best for me to give up my decade-plus of involvement in elementary if it meant it could continue on successfully.

Dani said she would send me a formal offer ASAP, but that she wouldn't send it without me agreeing to it first. I told her I intended to accept an offer but would of course need to have it reviewed by a lawyer. She didn't send any communication for five days, so I had my lawyer send what we had discussed as a possibly more amicable offer which included me retaining a small percentage of ownership while selling the rest to Dani—this would allow Dani complete control over the company while also protecting myself from completely missing out in case elementary were to sell in the near future. My lawyer also suggested we include a promissory note (basically an agreement to pay an additional sum out over a long period of time) to help reflect the intangibles that add value to the company, but this was easily the most negotiable part of the offer (and what I cared about the least).

Dani replied that this was not acceptable, and still refused to send a formal offer or counteroffer. She repeatedly called it a negotiation—and then said there was absolutely no room to negotiate. She again ceased all elementary-related work and communication for a week while I tried to continue to run things. After a bit more back and forth and while I was still trying to negotiate something amicable, Dani publicly shared her version of the story, including private company financials (which has since been picked up by the usual suspects in open source punditry) and actually lowered her offer. She also offered to be bought out of her shares for an even lower sum.

Again, I am honestly not concerned about the money, but I do want to make sure any legal agreement I am being told to sign is reviewed by a lawyer representing me, and represents an amicable deal. I don't think my efforts to negotiate were unreasonable, even if they took longer than I would have liked because of a lawyer being the go-between.

This is where we are now. FUTURE SPECULATION NOW

In the end, I have decided to give up on my decade-plus passion for elementary, and to let Dani be the sole owner. She now owns 100% of the shares and responsibility, and I wish her the best in continuing its legacy. Instead of being involved in elementary, I will focus my free-time efforts on contributing to GNOME, Flatpak, and those growing ecosystems. In many ways, this will be a continuation of my work from elementary where I championed the cross-desktop dark style, accent colors, and the AppCenter ecosystem.

Soon, I will be joining an open source company where I will continue to work with many familiar faces in the free desktop world while improving the lives of folks around the world—and I can't wait to get started. More on that soon.
