![Replacing Simple Bank]({{ page.image }})

This sucks. [BBVA US is closing Simple](https://www.simple.com/blog/simple-is-closing), migrating away from the revolutionary site and app to the BBVA US yet-another-bank-app. I've been [talking about this](https://twitter.com/CassidyJames/status/1347299178158804992) a little bit on Twitter [off and on](https://twitter.com/CassidyJames/status/1347615632984928257), and have found a _ton_ of other folks‚Äîincluding [a Change.org petition](http://chng.it/KXNzmJPx)‚Äîfacing the same dilemma: what now? What can possibly replace Simple? So here's my journey in looking for a replacement.

<aside markdown="1">
**Note:** I'll be updating this frequently as I do more research. And since Simple only ever served the US market, this piece will focus solely on options for US customers as well.
</aside>

## What Makes Simple Good?

I joined Simple soon after it launched as an invite-only beta in 2012, and it immediately replaced my previous big bank account. My wife joined when we got married, and we managed two individual accounts for a while. When Simple launched Simple Shared, we were first in line‚Äînearly literally; we beta tested it as soon as they announced it. Over the past decade, we have come to love and depend on the awesome features and incredibly straightforward experience of Simple.

Here‚Äôs how we currently use Simple, and the four things we value most:

### 1. A Bank, First and Foremost

So technically, Simple‚Äîand most online "banks"‚Äîwill tell you they are a _banking service_ and not explicitly a _bank;_ in Simple's case, BBVA US handles the actual bank side of things. But it was important to us that our online bank operated, well, like a bank. We were interested in a real bank account (with routing and account numbers), with real debit cards (e.g. provided by Visa or Mastercard), designed around being the primary way money comes into and goes out of our life.

This distinction is important in the modern age of "neobanks," where so many are designed around cash advances, cryptocurrencies, penny investing, peer-to-peer transactions, merchant-specific perks, and a thousand other things that feel like they distract from the core of what a bank should be. Many of these neobanks also lack table-stakes features like check deposits or bill payment. Simple, on the other hand, has steadily added all the bank-like features we've needed to be our one and only bank account while living our financial lives as usual.

### 2. Excellent User Experience

Everything from the website to the notifications and emails they send, to‚Äîof course‚Äîthe stellar mobile app are well designed and well thought out. It's a classic case of deceptively simple, too; other banks have tried to copy the trendy design and typography, but don't seem to be in the same league when it comes to the actual _experience_. Simple was good when it first came out, and they've constantly improved and refined it over the past decade.

The app is the big one, as it's one of the few banking apps that closely follows native Android guidelines while having its own distinct look and feel. It's fast, smooth, easy to do everything you can possibly do with your account right in the app. It also supports the system dark style out of the box.

Seriously, user experience is mainly where all other banks are years behind.

### 3. Simple Shared + Personal accounts

Simple started with personal accounts, but added well-integrated Shared accounts a few years ago. Shared is a bank account with its own account number under the hood (though you don't have to think about that). Its balance, transactions, goals, and expenses are visible to both users, and each person has a designated Shared debit card in addition to their personal debit card.

By default, my wife and I each log into our account and see the Shared account.  When one of our Shared cards is used, we both get a push notification with the merchant and amount, and the transaction is tagged with the profile picture of whoever‚Äôs card was used. This is where all incoming money (i.e. paychecks) go, and from where the vast majority of debits are made.

<aside markdown="1">
**Example:** You order some home supplies from Target online, using your Shared card. You and your partner both get a push notification with _**Target.com** Your Name: $49.57_, and tapping it brings you to the transaction in your Shared account (where you mark it as coming from the Home Supplies goal).

Later, you impulse-buy a candy bar and use your Personal card. Only you get a notification with _**7-Eleven** $1.49_, and tapping it brings you to the transaction in your Personal account.
</aside>

We use our personal accounts as our own pocket money. Simple has easy instant transfer to/from Shared and Personal accounts, so part of our budget is a small amount of money that we transfer from Shared into each of our Personal accounts with each pay period. We then use our Personal balances however we see fit, whether it‚Äôs for videogames, impulse purchases, personal subscriptions, or saving up for larger personal purchases that we don't justify including in our Shared budget. We also transfer our gift giving budget for one another (i.e. for birthdays and Christmas) into our Personal accounts to avoid spoiling gift purchases. We each have our own Personal debit card for this discretionary spending.

### 4. Goals + Expenses

Goals are where you set aside money (like cash in an envelope) for expected purchases that month, or save money for longer-term expenses (like contributing some money each month to an end of the year Christmas budget). Simple always defaults to showing your ‚ÄúSafe-to-Spend‚Äù balance, which is your account balance minus any Goals or Expenses. Under the hood, transactions come out of your actual balance (and thus the Safe-to-Spend), but can later be marked as coming out of a Goal.

<aside markdown="1">
**Example:** You have $100 in Safe-to-Spend and $200 in a Groceries goal. You buy $70 worth of groceries, and initially your Safe-to-Spend is reduced to $30 ($100 - $70). At the end of the day, you come back and mark the grocery transaction as coming from your Groceries goal, which returns your Safe-to-Spend to $100 and reduces your Groceries goal to $130 ($200 - $70).

If you over-spend your Safe-to-Spend (but not the underlying account balance), you get a notice that you've overspent it and Simple seamlessly covers it from your Goals balances. It is kind of confusing to explain, but means there's no risk of declining e.g. a $1,000 rent payment even if there is only $100 in Safe-to-Spend; you can square it up later as long as that money is in your account/Goals _somewhere_.
</aside>

My wife and I use a <abbr title="Income minus expenses equals zero; give every dollar a ‚Äújob‚Äù in the budget">"zero-based budget"</abbr> with ‚Äúenvelopes‚Äù in the form of 31 different Goals. Some of our Goals include Restaurants, Groceries, Home supplies, Auto maintenance, and <abbr title="Virtual envelopes we add to each month for longer-term expenses">‚Äúsinking funds‚Äù</abbr> for things like a self-insured vision fund (for contacts or glasses), and smartphone upgrades/replacements.

Expenses are a newer feature of Simple, and they're like automated Goals. They're automatically-funded and withdrawn-from buckets of money for known recurring things‚Äîand they're even pay-period-aware, only setting money aside when your paycheck actually comes in, and managable based on your pay schedule. You can choose a specific merchant or category to come out of any given expense.

We have 20 Expenses for things like rent, Internet service, and subscriptions like YouTube Music and Disney+. This means we can set and forget these things; the Expense is "filled" when we are paid, and then the transactions automatically come out of the appropriate Expense when we're charged.

<aside markdown="1">
**Example:** You get paid on the 1st and 15th of the month. Disney+ charges you $7 on the 19th of the month. You can set your Disney+ Expense to fill halfway on each payday (so $3.50 each on the 1st and 15th), or fully on one of the paydays (like the 15th). When you're paid, that amount automatically goes into your Expense, meaning you never see it in your Safe-to-Spend. When the 19th comes around, your Disney+ charge automatically comes out of your Disney+ Expense instead of ever reducing your Safe-to-Spend.
</aside>

We generally keep our Safe-to-Spend at $50‚Äì100 as a buffer for any small, unexpected things. But it is effectively a zero-based budget, and all managed within the Simple app thanks to Goals and Expenses.

## The Alternatives

Here are the alternatives to Simple that have been recommended to me (or that I've found), and how they measure up compared to Simple. Spoiler alert: nothing is quite on the same level yet.

### [One Finance](https://www.onefinance.com/)

Looks slick, but no shared/joint account support; however, [Shared Pockets might work](https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052767694-Joint-Accounts)! Doesn't appear to be as much automation as is built into Simple Expenses, though.

1. ‚úîÔ∏è **Designed to be a bank** service, nothing else. The default view in the app is your Pockets of money and recent transactions, another tab houses ways to move money (transferring in our out), and another tab shows details including your profile, card information, liked accounts, and statements. It's all very much bank stuff, and that's it.

2. ‚úîÔ∏è **Great app** design; feels distinct and native on Android. No dark style support at the moment though. üôàÔ∏è

3. ‚ùìÔ∏è **Shared Pockets** between personal accounts instead of a joint Simple Shared account; but I still need to see if this is workable as a replacement.

4. ‚ùìÔ∏è **Pockets** for envelope-style budgeting (replacing Simple Goals). But it sounds like you have to mark your card as spending from a Pocket _before_ the transaction, which would be a huge pain for e.g. online purchases and recurring charges; I'm waiting to learn more. I also have to look into Pockets and their automation more to see if they can replace Simple Expenses.

One _sounds_ really close, and for some, it might be a workable replacement to Simple. But personally, marking a card as spending from a Pocket before the transaction goes through sounds untenable.

<aside markdown="1">
**Note:** Someone from One has reached out to me and offered a demo of Shared Pockets, so I am looking forward to that and will update this piece when I know more.
</aside>

### [N26](https://n26.com/en-us)

Probably the best-looking app on the surface. [Only 2 "Spaces"](https://n26.com/en-us/spaces)‚Äînowhere near equivalent to the unlimited amount of Goals and Expenses in Simple, nor our 31 Goals and 20 Expenses in use. Bummer.

1. ‚úîÔ∏è **Mostly just bank stuff** in their app and on their website; the home tab has your balance and quick actions, the Spaces tab shows your envelope-style buckets of money, and the Cards tab shows your debit card information along with account numbers and some account-related actions. There is an Explore tab that shows some cashback perks and other partner offers, but it's pretty limited‚Äîand doesn't feel like it's trying to take over the whole app.

2. ‚úîÔ∏è **Great app** design; feels native on Android and feels really well thought out. Automatic or manual dark style, plus interesting, innovative features like "discrete mode" where dollar amounts are hidden when you wave your hand over the screen (enabled with the proximity sensor).

3. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Joint/shared accounts** not mentioned anywhere in their docs or app. The personal account doesn't appear to inter-operate with other personal accounts, either.

4. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Spaces** are limited to two. While Rules exist for automating Spaces, it's not practical to replace Simple Expenses since it's so limited

If you're looking for a very, _very_ simple personal replacement for Simple, N26 might do it for you. I am considering using it for my personal pocket money if I don't find a complete replacement for Simple Shared + Personal; but for anyone using more than two goals or expenses, it's not an option.

### [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-US/)

No information on their website or help center about joint/shared accounts, so unfortunately not looking like an option. They do have group "Vaults" and group-pay for bills, so it _might_ be worth looking into more.

1. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Not a bank service** up front; Revolut seems to be designed around international travelers and currency conversion. You _can_ dig deep in the app and find an account and routing number, but there is so much going on: a "Wealth" tab hawking cryptocurrencies alongide savings "Vaults," peer-to-peer payments and bill splitting, _tons_ of third-party offers and rewards that opt you into marketing emails and push notifications, travel features like access to airport lounges, and then the near-constant upsell to pay a monthly fee for a "Premium" or "Metal" account with _even more_ features. It's all a bit overwhelming.

2. ‚úîÔ∏è **Extremely polished** app and design; it's very trendy, relatively well organized even with the _tons_ of functionality packed in, and has plenty of slick and smooth animations that help communicate the spatial design. Automatic or manual dark style support.

3. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Joint/shared accounts** not supported, though they have group "Vaults" and group-pay for bills. Personal accounts exist, if you can find the account details. Peer-to-peer transfers do help two personal accounts interoperate.

4. ‚ùìÔ∏è **Category-based budgeting plus Vaults** for expenses and saving. You can set a budget for different categories per-month, and you can transfer money in and out of Vaults. But the categories are really limited, and you can't associate a transaction with a Vault; you have to manually transfer money out of it.

**Update:** After initially looking into their exceptionally slick app, someone shared this with me: [Revolut insiders reveal the human cost of a fintech unicorn's wild rise (Wired)](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/revolut-trade-unions-labour-fintech-politics-storonsky). Given that, I've lost interest in pursuing them more.

### [Chime](https://www.chime.com/)

[No joint/shared accounts.](https://chime.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003650988-Does-Chime-offer-joint-accounts-). They are also in the middle of [a class-action lawsuit due to a multi-day outage](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/money/banking-news/chime-digital-bank-outage-class-action-settlement/), which sounds pretty rough and turned me off from spending much time with it or transferring much money in to try it out.

1. ‚úîÔ∏è **Designed to be a bank** based on their website, app store listings, and available screenshots. The Home tab shows your balance and recent transactions, a Move Money tab houses transfers, a Pay Friends tab handles peer-to-peer payments, and an ATM Map helps you find places to withdraw cash.

2. ‚ùìÔ∏è **Okay app** that I didn't spend much time with (see above). It seems well laid-out, but doesn't feel entirely at home on Android. And no dark style support; it's blinding white all the time.

3. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Joint/shared accunts** not supported, though [they say they're aware](https://chime.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003650988-Does-Chime-offer-joint-accounts-) of the want and working on a solution. While peer-to-peer transfers exist, there doesn't seem to be any way to share a balance between two people.

4. ‚ùåÔ∏è **No envelope budgeting**. Chime offers a Spending and a Savings account, but no envelope- or Goals-style budgeting tools.

Chime might work for an individual account without budgeting needs, but it just seems too barebones for me.

### [Qube](https://qubemoney.com/)

Looks interesting‚Äîbased around the envelope budgeting style like Simple, but is in beta. Qube Couples has not launched yet.

1. ‚úîÔ∏è **Designed to be a bank** with only checking and saving bank-related things presented in the app.

2. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Not a fan of their app**, as it seems simultaneously dated and over-designed. I kind of feel like it's an iOS port or something, as the design patterns don't feel at home on Android. No dark style support.

3. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Qube Couples** is supposedly in the works, but not available yet.

4. ‚ùìÔ∏è **Qubes** appear to be some sort of envelope-like system using virtual card numbers, but it isn't as seamless as Goals or Expenses.

Qube looks like it could be a contender some day, but I would not recommend it in its current beta state; too many base features are missing.

### [Cash App](https://cash.app)

Cash App was initially a barebones peer-to-peer payment app launched by payment processor Square, but it has grown into an interesting potential bank replacement for some people.

1. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Not a bank**, though‚Äîit's still built around peer-to-peer payments with "investing" via Bitcoin or stocks bolted on. You _can_ get a debit card to spend your balance, and can find the account and routing numbers under the hood for things like direct deposits or transfers. But it's clearly not designed to replace a regular bank.

2. ‚úîÔ∏è **Well-designed app** that has blossomed from an almost brutally-minimalist peer-to-peer app to something that helps you manage your balance and card, send or request money, and invest.

3. ‚ùåÔ∏è **No joint support**, though peer-to-peer payments do make sending money back and forth easy and instant.

4. ‚ùåÔ∏è **No budgeting** tools whatsoever.

If I were to use one of these apps as a pool for my own pocket money alongside a joint account, it would be Cash App thanks to its simplicity‚Äîplus most people I need to pay have it as well, making it instant to pay people back or request a few bucks for something.

### [Venmo](https://venmo.com)

One of the earliest and most popular peer-to-peer payment apps, Venmo was bought out by PayPal but continues to be its own thing.

1. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Not a bank**;  built around social peer-to-peer payments. Like Cash App, you can get a debit card to spend your balance, but it's clearly not designed to replace a regular bank.

2. ‚ùåÔ∏è **Confusing app** that doesn't feel native to Android _at all_. I feel like it used to be more straightforward, but the latest design update since it was bought by PayPal made it feel like a poorly-ported iOS app, and it's very confusing to use‚Äîeven without a whole lot of functionality here.

3. ‚ùåÔ∏è **No joint support**, but again, instant peer-to-peer transfers are here.

4. ‚ùåÔ∏è **No budgeting** tools whatsoever.

At this point, Venmo seems to only be convenient if you have others in your life who use Venmo and are willing to put up with the convoluted app. But I'd recommend Cash App for a much better-designed app and service.

## Others Considered

These options were recommended to me or came up in my search for a replacement, but haven't launched yet or didn't meet the bar for me to actually sign up and try them out.

### [Current](https://current.com)

Looks nice, but [no joint account support.](https://support.current.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043876754-Can-I-sign-up-for-a-joint-account-)

### [Dave](https://dave.com)

Seems focused on cash advances and side hustles which isn't appealing to me at all. No information on their site about shared/joint accounts or anything like Simple Goals.

### [Varo](https://varomoney.com)

[No shared/joint accounts.](https://faq.varomoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050197531-Does-Varo-Bank-offer-joint-Bank-Accounts-)

### [Qapital](https://www.qapital.com/)

Qapital charges $3/month for their basic savings features, $6/month for a debit card and investment features, and $12/month for their "Master" plan with "Money Missions" and early access to new features. I didn't sign up just to try it out, so I don't feel comfortable judging it alongside the options I did try.

### [Monzo](https://monzo.com/usa/)

Not launched in the US; on a waitlist system.

### [Google ~~Pay~~ Plex](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex#XflVHM)

Not yet launched; coming this year.

### Credit Union

Every local one has the same decade-old looking mobile app and don't support anything like Simple Goals or Expenses.

---

So that's where I'm at. I'm currently looking more into One Finance, as it seems like the best option I've found. It's also possible the BBVA US app will be _fine_ if they find a way to transfer over the Goals and Expenses from Simple, but I'm not that optimistic.

I will continue this search and update this post with more details and options as I get them!
