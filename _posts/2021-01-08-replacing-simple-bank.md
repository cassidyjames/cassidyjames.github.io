![Replacing Simple Bank]({{ page.image }})

This sucks. [BBVA US is closing Simple](https://www.simple.com/blog/simple-is-closing), migrating away from the revolutionary site and app to the BBVA US yet-another-bank-app. I've been [talking about this](https://twitter.com/CassidyJames/status/1347299178158804992) a little bit on Twitter [off and on](https://twitter.com/CassidyJames/status/1347615632984928257), and have found a _ton_ of other folks‚Äîincluding [a Change.org petition](http://chng.it/KXNzmJPx)‚Äîfacing the same dilemma: what now? What can possibly replace Simple? So here's my journey in looking for a replacement.

**Note:** I'll be updating this frequently as I do more research.

## Simple

I joined Simple soon after it launched, and it immediately replaced my previous big bank account. My wife joined when we got married, and we managed two individual accounts for a while. When Simple launched Simple Shared, we were first in line‚Äînearly literally; we beta tested it as soon as they announced it. Over the past decade, we have come to love and depend on the awesome features and incredibly straightforward experience of Simple.

Here‚Äôs how we currently use Simple, and what we value:

- **Excellent user experience** with everything from the website to the notifications and emails they send, to‚Äîof course‚Äîthe stellar mobile app. The app is the big one, as it's one of the few banking apps that closely follows native Android guidelines while having its own distinct look and feel. It's fast, smooth, easy to do everything you can possibly do with your account right in the app. Seriously, this is mainly where all other banks are years behind.

- **Shared account.** By default, we each log into our account and see the Shared account. This is a bank account with its own account number under the hood (though you don't have to think about that). Its balance, transactions, goals, and expenses are shared and visible to both of us, and we each have a designated Shared debit card. When one of our cards is used, we both get a push notification, and the transaction is tagged with the profile picture of whoever‚Äôs card was used. This is where all incoming money (i.e. paychecks) go, and from where the vast majority of debits are made.

- **Zero-based budget** with ‚Äúenvelopes‚Äù in the form of **31 Goals**. Goals are where you set aside money (like cash in an envelope!) for expected purchases that month, or save money for longer-term expenses (like contributing some money each month to our end of the year Christmas budget). Some of our Goals include Restaurants/take-out, Groceries/home supplies, Auto maintenance, and ‚Äúsinking funds‚Äù for things like a self-insured vision fund (for contacts or glasses), and smartphone upgrades/replacements. Simple always defaults to showing your ‚ÄúSafe to Spend‚Äù balance, which is your account balance minus any Goals or Expenses. We keep our Safe to Spend at $50 as a tiny buffer for any small, unexpected things‚Äîbut it is effectively a zero-based budget.

- **20 Expenses** automatically-funded and withdrawn-from buckets of money for known recurring things like rent, Internet, and Disney+. These are a lot like Goals, but with more paycheck-aware automation.

- **Personal accounts** as our own pocket money. Simple has easy instant transfer to/from Shared and Personal accounts, so part of our budget is a small amount of money that we transfer from Shared into each of our Personal accounts with each pay period. We then use our Personal balances however we see fit, whether it‚Äôs for videogames, impulse purchases, personal subscriptions, or saving up for larger personal purchases that we don't justify including in our Shared budget. We also transfer our gift giving budget for one another (i.e. for birthdays and Christmas) into our Personal accounts to avoid spoiling gift purchases. We each have our own Personal debit card for this discretionary spending.

## [One Finance](https://www.onefinance.com/)

Looks slick, but no shared/joint account support; however, [Shared Pockets might work](https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052767694-Joint-Accounts)! Doesn't appear to be as much automation as is built into Simple Expenses, though. Currently my front-runner.

‚úîÔ∏è **Great app** design; feels distinct and native on Android. No dark style support at the moment though. üôàÔ∏è

‚ùìÔ∏è **Shared Pockets** instead of a Simple Shared account

‚úîÔ∏è **Pockets** for envelope-style budgeting (replacing Simple Goals)

‚ùìÔ∏è **Expenses**? I have to look into this more

‚úîÔ∏è **Personal account** since that's how One works by default: personal accounts plus Shared Pockets

## [N26](https://n26.com/en-us)

The best-looking app on the surface. [Only 2 "Spaces"](https://n26.com/en-us/spaces)‚Äînowhere near equivalent to the unlimited amount of Goals and Expenses in Simple, nor our 31 Goals and 20 Expenses in use. Bummer.

‚úîÔ∏è **Great app** design; feels native on Android and feels really well thought out. Great dark style, too!

‚ùåÔ∏è **Joint/shared accounts** not mentioned anywhere in their docs

‚ùåÔ∏è **Spaces** are limited to two

‚ùåÔ∏è **Rules** exist for Spaces, but since due to the above, it's not practical to replace Simple Expenses

‚ùåÔ∏è **Personal account** exists but doesn't inter-operate with other personal accounts.

## [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-US/)

No information on their website or help center about joint/shared accounts, so unfortunately not looking like an option. They do have group "Vaults" and group-pay for bills, so it _might_ be worth looking into more.

## [Chime](https://www.chime.com/)

[No joint/shared accounts.](https://chime.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003650988-Does-Chime-offer-joint-accounts-)

## [Qube](https://qubemoney.com/)

Looks interesting‚Äîbased around the envelope budgeting style like Simple, but is in beta. Qube Couples has not launched yet.

## [Current](https://current.com)

Looks nice, but [no joint account support.](https://support.current.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043876754-Can-I-sign-up-for-a-joint-account-)

## [Dave](https://dave.com)

Seems focused on cash advances and side hustles which isn't appealing to me at all. No information on their site about shared/joint accounts or anything like Simple Goals.

## [Monzo](https://monzo.com/usa/)

Not launched in the US; on a waitlist system.

## [Google ~~Pay~~ Plex](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex#XflVHM)

Not yet launched

## Credit Union

Every local one has the same decade-old looking mobile app and don't support anything like Simple Goals or Expenses.
