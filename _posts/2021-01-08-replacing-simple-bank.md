This sucks. [BBVA US is closing Simple](https://www.simple.com/blog/simple-is-closing), migrating away from the revolutionary site and app to the BBVA US yet-another-bank-app.

## Simple

- 31 Goals (envelope-like budgeting buckets that are excluded from the "Safe to Spend")
- 20 Expenses (automatically-funded and withdrawn-from buckets of money)
- Shared (balance, transactions, goals, and expenses are shared)
- Personal (instant transfer to/from Shared to personal accounts, i.e. for pocket money or gifts)

## One

Looks slick, no shared/joint account support yet? But Shared Pockets might work! Not as much automation as is built into Simple, though.

## N24

Only 2 "Spaces" (or 10 if you pay for a premium account.) Nowhere near equivalent to the unlimited amount of Goals and Expenses in Simple, nor our 31 Goals and 20 Expenses.

## Chime

[No joint/shared accounts.](https://chime.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003650988-Does-Chime-offer-joint-accounts-)

## Qube

## Current

## Monzo

Not launched in the US

## Google Pay Plex

Not yet launched

## Credit Union

Every local one has the same decade-old looking mobile app and don't support anything like Simple Goals or Expenses.
