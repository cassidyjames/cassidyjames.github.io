This sucks. [BBVA US is closing Simple](https://www.simple.com/blog/simple-is-closing), migrating away from the revolutionary site and app to the BBVA US yet-another-bank-app.

## Simple

I joined Simple soon after it launched, and it immediately replaced my previous big bank account. My wife joined when we got married, and we managed two individual accounts for a while. When Simple launched Simple Shared, we were first in line—nearly literally; we beta tested it as soon as they announced it. Over the past decade, we have come to love and depend on the awesome features and incredibly straightforward experience of Simple.

Here’s how we currently use Simple:

- **Shared account.** By default, we each log into our account and see the Shared account. This is a bank account with its own account number under the hood (though you don't have to think about that). Its balance, transactions, goals, and expenses are shared and visible to both of us, and we each have a designated Shared debit card. When one of our cards is used, we both get a push notification, and the transaction is tagged with the profile picture of whoever’s card was used. This is where all incoming money (i.e. paychecks) go.

- **Zero-based budget** with “envelopes” in the form of **31 Goals**. Goals are where you set aside money (like cash in an envelope!) for expected purchases that month, or save money for longer-term expenses (like contributing some money each month to our end of the year Christmas budget). Some of our Goals include Restaurants/take-out, Groceries/home supplies, Auto maintenance, and “sinking funds” for things like a self-insured vision fund (for contacts or glasses), and smartphone upgrades/replacements. Simple always defaults to showing your “Safe to Spend” balance, which is your account balance minus any Goals or Expenses. We keep our Safe to Spend at $50 as a tiny buffer for any small, unexpected things—but it is effectively a zero-based budget.

- **20 Expenses** automatically-funded and withdrawn-from buckets of money for known recurring things like rent, Internet, and Disney+. These are a lot like Goals, but with more paycheck-aware automation.

- **Personal accounts** as our own pocket money. Simple has easy instant transfer to/from Shared and Personal accounts, so part of our budget is a small amount of money that we transfer from Shared into each of our Personal accounts with each pay period. We then use our Personal balances however we see fit, whether it’s for videogames, impulse purchases, personal subscriptions, or saving up for larger personal purchases that we don't justify including in our Shared budget.

## One

Looks slick, no shared/joint account support yet? But Shared Pockets might work! Not as much automation as is built into Simple, though.

## N24

Only 2 "Spaces" (or 10 if you pay for a premium account.) Nowhere near equivalent to the unlimited amount of Goals and Expenses in Simple, nor our 31 Goals and 20 Expenses.

## Chime

[No joint/shared accounts.](https://chime.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003650988-Does-Chime-offer-joint-accounts-)

## Qube

## Current

## Monzo

Not launched in the US

## Revolut

No information on their website or help center about joint/shared accounts, so unfortunately not an option.

## Google Pay Plex

Not yet launched

## Credit Union

Every local one has the same decade-old looking mobile app and don't support anything like Simple Goals or Expenses.
