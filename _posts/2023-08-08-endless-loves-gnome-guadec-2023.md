title: Endless ♥ GNOME at GUADEC 2023
updated: 2023-08-08

In July, Endless sponsored and attended the annual [GNOME](https://gnome.org) conference, [GUADEC](https://guadec.org), in Rīga, Latvia. We have a long history of supporting and collaborating within the GNOME open source project, and it was great to support GUADEC again this year as the platinum sponsor of the event.

Our support of GUADEC and GNOME is more than just a sponsorship, though; we showed up and participated all week to present and plan for our continued contributions to GNOME. The conference is designed around a one-day advisory board meeting, a few days of talks, and a few days of working sessions.

### Advisory Board Meeting

We joined representatives from other organizations using and invested in the success of GNOME in meeting with the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors for an all-day Advisory Board meeting. There we discussed improving the accessibility of GNOME, the travel sponsorship process, reproducible builds for apps, how organizations can better upstream their non-code contributions to GNOME, and other topics raised by member organizations.

### Talks

Endless OS Foundation employees presented a total of nine talks across three broad topics:

#### Design

##### GNOME Design: State of the Union
Cassidy James Blaede, Partner Success Engineer (co-presented w/other GNOME designers)

The GNOME design team talk about their work over the past year, their plans for the future, and the general state of GNOME user experience.

##### How to Make a Delightful App Listing
Cassidy James Blaede, Partner Success Engineer 

Over the years I’ve helped build app ecosystems built on open standards. Learn how to present your app in its best light in app stores like GNOME Software, Flathub, and more.

#### Sharing Knowledge

##### Reaching New Users With GNOME
Robert McQueen, CEO

Insights, knowledge, and ways forward learned by our work at Endless—particularly around how first-time computer users (including both kids and adults) are an impactful target audience for the work we do on GNOME.

##### Maintaining Healthy Upstream Relationships as a Small Team
Dylan McCall, Software Engineer

Techniques for effectively communicating upstream, fostering a culture of collaboration, and managing disagreements. Learn the benefits and challenges of thinking upstream first while building for a unique vision using real-world examples from our own experiences with projects like GNOME.

##### What is the GNOME Advisory Board?
Cassidy James Blaede, Partner Success Engineer

Impromptu "lightning talk" (five-minute talk prepared day-of) about my experience on the GNOME Advisory Board including what it is, how it works, how it helps GNOME, and why more organizations should join.

#### Technical

##### State of the Shell
Georges Basile Stavracas Neto, Software Engineer (co-presented w/other GNOME Shell developers)

With GNOME 43 and 44 released, there is much to celebrate since last year. Learn about the improvements, highlights, and latest development plans in Mutter and GNOME Shell.

##### Reducing Power & Bandwidth Use in Apps to Keep Users Happy
Philip Withnall, Senior Software Engineer

Users who on battery power or a mobile connection can have a frustrating experience with apps that use a lot of power or keep downloading things—this can even lead to large charges before the user realizes. GNOME provides ways to change app behavior to save power and bandwidth when appropriate; learn how you can do this in your own app. 

##### Slow Progress on App Save/Restore Support
Philip Withnall, Senior Software Engineer

Over the last year, some progress has slowly been made on adding support for saving and restoring app state across restarts. See an overview of where we’re at, the architecture being used, and what’s left to do.

### Working Sessions

Endless OS Foundation employees attended a variety of workshops including GTK Planning, GNOME Release Team, and GNOME OS. Throughout the week we also had countless conversations in hallways and over meals with other GNOME contributors—all of which helps share knowledge and shape the direction of GNOME.

### What is GNOME?
GNOME is an expansive open source community developing an entirely free and open source modern computing ecosystem. GNOME technologies serve as the user interface and much of the technical stack of the most popular Linux-based operating systems including Endless OS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and more.

Anyone can use and contribute to GNOME technologies to provide an alternative to Microsoft Windows, Google ChromeOS and Android, or Apple macOS and iOS.

#### GNOME Advisory Board
The GNOME Foundation is the non-profit organization that supports the GNOME community with staff, infrastructure, trademarks, legal framework, etc. The GNOME Foundation Board of Directors is democratically elected by the community to support and guide GNOME.

Since GNOME technologies are so widely used, it's beneficial to get the input and advice from other organizations that are invested in the success of GNOME—like Endless OS Foundation! The GNOME Advisory Board is an advisory committee made up of such organizations and meets with each other and the elected GNOME Foundation Board of Directors twice annually. There's no decision-making authority, but it's a way to collaborate and share individual organizations' plans as they relate to their financial, technical, or labor investments into GNOME for the coming year.

Cassidy is passionate about designing and building useful, usable, and delightful products using open technologies. In the past he co-founded elementary OS and served as the chief experience architect, and he's worked as a UX architect, web developer, and writer—and worn many, many other hats. He contributes to GNOME and the Flatpak ecosystem.

Outside of work and open source he enjoys photography, video games, watching and reading almost everything Star Wars, collecting way too much media on his Plex server, and being a dad.
