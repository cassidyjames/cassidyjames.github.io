# Stadia (RIP)

I was <a href="https://stadia.google.com/profile/4101661881179489453" class="profile">cassidyjames<span class="hash">#6270</span></a> on [Stadia], the free gaming service from Google. You could buy your games and play them in up to 1080p anywhere on your phone, tablet, computer, or TVâ€”with the controller you already have, or with the Stadia controller.

I mostly played **Destiny 2** which was free to play for the base game, so you could hop on Stadia and join me.

[~~Play Stadia~~][stadia]
[~~Try Stadia Pro~~][stadia]{: .button.stadia }
</div>

[Stadia Pro][stadia] was a paid subscription that got you up to 4K HDR and surround sound on Stadia, plus new games to claim and add to your library each month at no extra cost.
