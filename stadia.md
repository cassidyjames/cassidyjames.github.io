I'm <a href="https://stadia.google.com/profile/4101661881179489453" class="profile">cassidyjames<span class="hash">#6270</span></a> on [Stadia], the free gaming service from Google. You buy your games and play them in up to 1080p anywhere on your phone, tablet, computer, or TVâ€”with the controller you already have, or with the new Stadia controller.

I mostly play **Destiny 2** which is free to play for the base game, so you can hop on Stadia and join me!

[Stadia Pro][stadia] is a paid subscription that gets you up to 4K HDR and surround sound on Stadia, plus new games to claim and add to your library each month at no extra cost.
