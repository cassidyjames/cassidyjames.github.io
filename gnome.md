Building useful, usable, delightful products that respect privacy using open technologies.

Partner Success Engineer at the [Endless OS Foundation](https://endlessos.org), GNOME design contributor, and member of the [GNOME Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/). Previously, I co-founded [elementary, Inc.](https://elementary.io) supporting elementary OS and was the UX architect at [System76](https://system76.com) working on the initial GNOME-based version of [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/).

I have a background and expertise in user experience, open source, product design, communication, and project coordination.
