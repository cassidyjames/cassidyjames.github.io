## General Advice

- Matter is the future, Zigbee is the present

- Don’t be afraid of a Zigbee hub

- Lots of smart home stuff is Zigbee even if you don’t realize it:
  - IKEA Home Smart/TRÅDFRI/DIRIGERA
  - Philips Hue
  - Aqara
  - Sonoff
  - Third Reality
  - Comcast Xfinity security
  - Cree
  - Lightify
  - OSRAM
  - Sylvania

- HomeKit compatibility is worth it for the long run even if you don’t use Apple today

- It’s not a problem to start in one ecosystem, just avoid products that _only_ work in one ecosystem

- Home Assistant is kinda scary, but 1000× better than it was even just a year ago—and 100% worth it

- Avoid Wi-Fi devices unless you think you will only ever have a small handful
