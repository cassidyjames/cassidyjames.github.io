## General Advice

- Matter is the future, Zigbee is the present

- Don‚Äôt be afraid of a Zigbee hub

- Lots of smart home stuff is Zigbee even if you don‚Äôt realize it:
  - IKEA Home Smart/TR√ÖDFRI/DIRIGERA
  - Philips Hue
  - Aqara
  - Sonoff
  - Third Reality
  - Comcast Xfinity security
  - Cree
  - Lightify
  - OSRAM
  - Sylvania

- HomeKit compatibility is worth it for the long run even if you don‚Äôt use Apple today

- It‚Äôs not a problem to start in one ecosystem, just avoid products that _only_ work in one ecosystem

- Home Assistant is kinda scary, but 1000√ó better than it was even just a year ago‚Äîand 100% worth it

- Avoid Wi-Fi devices unless you think you will only ever have a small handful

## Device Reviews

Maybe ‚Äúreview‚Äù is a strong word, but here are some impressions/experiences I‚Äôve had with various smart home devices.

### Lighting

From bulbs to permanent fixtures, this is the category in which I have the most devices.

#### **IKEA** (Home Smart, TR√ÖDFRI) _üëç Recommend_

I recommend them! I have multiple TR√ÖDFRI color bulbs and they are some of the most reliable. I don‚Äôt love their RGB color reproduction, though; it leans more pastel and less saturated (they seem to mix white in no matter what). I also have multiple FLOALT skylight-style lights and _really_ like their look. One arrived with broken tunable white, but IKEA‚Äôs customer service was great and replaced it ASAP.
