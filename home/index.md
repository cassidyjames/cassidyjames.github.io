## General Advice

- Matter is the future, Zigbee is the present

- Don‚Äôt be afraid of a Zigbee hub

- Lots of smart home stuff is Zigbee even if you don‚Äôt realize it:
  - IKEA Home Smart/TR√ÖDFRI/DIRIGERA
  - Philips Hue
  - Aqara
  - Sonoff
  - Third Reality
  - Comcast Xfinity security
  - Cree
  - Lightify
  - OSRAM
  - Sylvania

- HomeKit compatibility is worth it for the long run even if you don‚Äôt use Apple today

- It‚Äôs not a problem to start in one ecosystem, just avoid products that _only_ work in one ecosystem

- Home Assistant is kinda scary, but 1000√ó better than it was even just a year ago‚Äîand 100% worth it

- Avoid Wi-Fi devices unless you think you will only ever have a small handful

## Device Reviews

Maybe ‚Äúreview‚Äù is a strong word, but here are some impressions/experiences I‚Äôve had with various smart home devices.

### Lighting

From bulbs to permanent fixtures, this is the category in which I have the most devices.

#### IKEA (Home Smart, TR√ÖDFRI) _üëç Recommend_

I recommend them! I have multiple TR√ÖDFRI color bulbs and they are some of the most reliable. I don‚Äôt love their RGB color reproduction, though; it leans more pastel and less saturated (they seem to mix white in no matter what).

I also have multiple FLOALT skylight-style lights and _really_ like their look. One arrived with broken tunable white, but IKEA‚Äôs customer service was great and replaced it ASAP.

They work as expected with the IKEA DIRIGERA hub, but they also work great with Home Assistant over Zigbee‚Äîthey even receive firmware updates out of the box.

#### Cree _üëç Recommend_

I have around a dozen of these warm white Cree bulbs and they have been by far the most reliable in my house. I honestly don‚Äôt think I have ever had to power cycle even one of them over the past couple of years; they just keep on trucking, and extending the Zigbee mesh network all the same.

The one minor complaint I have is that a couple of them flicker at 1% brightness in some of my fixtures; this may not be noticable to you or even affect you/your lighting fixtures, and it is easier resolved by using 5% brightness instead‚Äîbut I thought I would mention it for completeness sake.

#### Lightify, OSRAM, Sylvania _üëé Avoid_

Oh boy. I found a good deal on a lot of these lights on eBay and have regretted ever since.

Some folks say they work fine for them! It may be a conflict with a specific device, Zigbee channel, neighbor interference, or just a bad batch, but **every single one** of these bulbs has had issues ranging from annoying (glitchy color changing), to unacceptable (requiring a reset to come back online every week or two), to literally unusable (falling off the network and never coming back‚Äîeven post factory reset).

Apparently there were sold under the Lightify brand with their own hub, but some bulbs are advertised under the OSRAM and Sylvania brands. Lightify shut down and stopped supporting their hub, but thanks to the magic of Zigbee, _technically_ the bulbs should still be fine to use with other hubs. But I do **not** recommend it under any circumstances based on my experiences.

### Motion, Presence, Occupancy

While smart lights are a natural starting point, motion sensors are what really sold me on automating all the things: I love never having to think about turning lights on or off; they just do the right thing when someone walks into the room, and turn off when nobody is around.

#### Third Reality _üëç Recommend_

These are my favorite cheap motion sensors! Like most inexpensive motion sensors, they are infrared which means they detect _motion_, but not _presence_; that is, if you stay still, they will not detect you. This is compensated for by setting the timeout for automations to a sufficiently long period, e.g. ten minutes (the lights will only turn off after there is no motion for ten minutes straight). Because of this, many motion sensors have a long, unchangeable time-out out of the box, like 1‚Äì5 minutes. 

However, these Third Reality sensors have a _very_ short time-out‚Äîlike immediate‚Äîwhich makes them very responsive when you want them to be. I take advantage of this with a nightstand light automation that turns on when there is motion detected at night (e.g. I get out of bed) but turns off as soon as no motion is detected (to minimize disturbing my partner).

These sensors have also been some of the more reliable ones, are powered by a standard AAA battery, receive regular firmware updates through Home Assistant, and are super easy to mount and replace. Due to all of this, they‚Äôre my faves!

#### IKEA TR√ÖDFRI _üëç Recommend_

These were my first motion sensors and they are acceptable, just not quite as nice as the Third Reality ones. They are inexpensive, relatively reliable, and have some level of water resistance so they are fine e.g. under an eave for an outdoor lighting automation.

They are a bit bulkier and harder to replace the batteries in as a result, though.
