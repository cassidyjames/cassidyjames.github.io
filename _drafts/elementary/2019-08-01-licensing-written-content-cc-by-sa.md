You might have noticed something new at the bottom of blog posts lately:

---

{% include license.html %}

We've determined that the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) allows the most freedom for derivative works while retaining the open spirit of elementary OS. We chose **not** to use a non-commercial license because we know that all too-often it can be unclear what is commercial versus non-commercial content. Instead, we focused on the Share-Alike portion of the license: you can use, remix, and adapt our posts however you'd like, but you have to re-share under the same license.

In this way, we hope translators, content creators, and other open source projects can benefit from our work while keeping the open source spirit alive.
