A few moments ago, we hit 100% funded for [our AppCenter campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/appcenter-the-pay-what-you-want-app-store/x/2795974) on Indiegogo. Thank you, backers! More than 300 people backed us over just two weeks to help bring our pay-what-you-want indie app store to life.

## What’s Next

Now that our goal has been met, we will complete arrangements for our mid-March AppCenter sprint in Denver, Colorado. Plane and train tickets are being booked, lodging is being arranged, and our itinerary is being finalized.

As soon as the campaign ends, we’ll add our backers to the Backers.md file and arrange the tee/sweatshirt rewards through our merch partner Printful.

Speaking of rewards…

## You can still contribute!

If you were waiting to help back our campaign but are bummed it’s over: **it’s not! **We can continue to accept pledges and offer rewards until the campaign ends in early March (30 days after it began).

We set our goal to the relatively modest $8,000 because that was the bare minimum budget to have a single sprint in Denver. Any campaign funds raised beyond that will still go toward AppCenter, i.e. paying developers to contribute, funding future sprints, etc.

## Thank You

We’d like to thank everyone again for their contributions. Each of our backers helped us meet our goal, and we are thrilled that so many share our vision of the future of elementary OS and AppCenter.
