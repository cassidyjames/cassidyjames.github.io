Over the last 24 hours, we’ve made a handful of improvements to [our website](https://elementary.io), starting with…

## Get Involved

The largest update to the site is on the [Get Involved](https://elementary.io/get-involved) page. We reworked some page-wide styling, but most importantly, redesigned the [Funding](https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding) section. We added icons and logos instead of heading copy ([#1521](https://github.com/elementary/website/pull/1521)), separated Patreon and PayPal, added clearer copy, and added a section for our Store ([#1517](https://github.com/elementary/website/pull/1517)). We also now call more attention to Bountysource by giving it its own standalone section.

## Store

In addition to getting prime billing in the Funding section, we made a minor improvement to the [Store](https://elementary.io/store) page itself. We’ve noticed some people were unaware we have worldwide shipping, so we added a heading and paragraph with shipping information ([#1516](https://github.com/elementary/website/pull/1516)).

## And More!

We also cleaned up some bitesize issues that were bothering us and did some tidying of navigation. Our social icons (Google+, Twitter, Medium, etc.) are now much easier to find at the top of the page ([#1494](https://github.com/elementary/website/pull/1494)), we added a link to the Open Source page to our footer navigation ([#1523](https://github.com/elementary/website/pull/1523)), we added a second call to action at the bottom of the homepage to shoot you back up to the top, and we slightly reworked the homepage hero ([#1512](https://github.com/elementary/website/pull/1512)). Alone, none of these are a huge change, but together they help make the site easier to navigate.

## Looking to Contribute?

Our website, like everything at elementary, is completely open source. Check out [our GitHub project](https://github.com/elementary/website) to contribute; at the moment there are over 50 open bugs, several of which are marked as bitesize. Happy hacking, and happy 2017. :)
