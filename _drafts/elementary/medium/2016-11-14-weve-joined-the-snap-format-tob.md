Members from across the Open Source community make up this board, including ones from Appstream, Arch, Debian, KDE, Ubuntu, and Fedora. In Jamie’s words,
> “The Snap Format Technical Oversight Board is independent, with no single company having a majority say, and it has the ability to prevent any change in the format or standard interfaces which all implementations are expected to support. In this way, we can be confident that different groups implementing the specification will have the ability to influence it as needed.”

We’d like to take a moment to thank Canonical and the Snap community for giving us this opportunity!
