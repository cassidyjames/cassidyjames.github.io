Wanted to take a moment before spending time with family to be thankful for all of my amazing friends, mentors, supporters, and everyone in between!

I’m thankful for Chris Smart for introducing me to Linux and continuing to be very supportive.

I’m thankful to Mark Shuttleworth and the Ubuntu team for all of their progress on making Linux useful and usable to all kinds of people and the for the things I learned while working for Canonical and for everything that we still benefit from by building on Ubuntu

I’m thankful to the GNOME team for all of their hard work on creating a really great open source application stack and always looking towards the future. I’m especially thankful to folks like Matthias Clasen, Christian Hergert, and Cosimo Cecchi who have listened and mentored and helped us and been great friends along the way.

I’m also very thankful for folks like Chris Fisher and Bryan Lunduke, and yes even Alex Diavatis ;p Thank you all for your passion and for getting our work to the world.

I’m of course very very thankful for the wonderful team at elementary and all the amazing things they do. They’re never afraid to try new things. To ask questions. To learn and try and grow and become more than what they were before. If nothing else, I’m very proud that we can be an incubator for these amazing people to grow their skills.

And last but certainly not least I am very thankful to all the people who provide their support in all the little things they do. Especially for the folks that put food on my table, but also for the people who take the time to answer other’s questions, who share the things they’ve made, who share their experiences and feedback, and even the quiet ones who just enjoy the thing we put out.

Thanks to everyone and I hope you have a wonderful day :)
