It might look simple, but Color Picker by Ronny Dobra is a well-designed utility that has become a staple for my work. When you launch it, Color Picker instantly opens a magnifying picker. Clicking picks a color and displays the value in the selected format.

Each color that’s picked also gets added to the palette at the bottom, keeping a history of six recent colors for future reference. The dropdown has several formats to choose from, including HEX, RGB, and more specialized formats. Finally, the entry with the color has a handy “copy” button to instantly copy the color in the selected format to the clipboard.

Color Picker is great for web development, icon design, or just any time you want to grab a specific color. The fact that it always remembers its state—including the last six colors and the selected format—when closing and reopening makes it super quick to open, pick a color, and continue on with your work. There’s no complicated UI to learn or manage, and its small and lightweight nature make it feel like more of a small piece of your workflow than a whole separate app.
