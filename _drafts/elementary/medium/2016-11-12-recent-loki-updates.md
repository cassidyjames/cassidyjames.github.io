The panel got some special attention where we fixed several minor performance and stability issues including:

* A fix from [w0xel](https://launchpad.net/~bastiwuerl) for a crasher in the sound indicator caused by some Electron apps that don’t implement the specification correctly

* [Peter](https://launchpad.net/~parnold-x) fixed an issue in the Ayatana compatibility indicator where certain apps were having trouble updating their menu items.

* [Felipe](https://launchpad.net/~philip.scott) addressed an issue where the sound indicator would show duplicated controls when a non-default music player was used.

Jeremy resolved some Drag-n-Drop issues and fixed a couple of crashes in Files, including one involving restoring files from the Trash.

AppCenter received several stability and performance updates from a few different contributors including the ability to search while in categories. We’ve also addressed an especially troublesome issue where it would generate several authentication dialogs when resuming from sleep.

Lastly, Videos gained a major new feature: it now has a searchable library view and fully supports keyboard navigation thanks to [Artem](https://launchpad.net/~artem-anufrij). We’re really excited about adding this view and we’re looking forward to adding more and better features for browsing and managing your video library.

As always, new releases come with translation updates for a more fully and accurately translated system. Thanks again to our translations teams for bringing elementary OS to more people around the world.

It just wouldn’t be an elementary blog post if we didn’t take the time to say thank you to our supporters on [Bountysource](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/elementary), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/elementary), backers on [PayPal](https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding), and everyone who has purchased a copy of elementary OS or ordered merch from [our store](https://elementary.io/store/). Your contributions allow us to keep these updates coming!
