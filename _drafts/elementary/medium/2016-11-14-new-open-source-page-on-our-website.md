You probably already know that elementary OS is built on top of Linux and every piece of software we write is open source, but you might not know that there’s a lot of other open source bits in between. Today, we published a new page on our website to show off some of the awesome open source organizations and the important software they’ve written that makes elementary OS possible. We’d like to say “Thank You!” and we hope you’ll take a second to check out their websites as well :)
