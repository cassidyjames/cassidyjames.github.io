title: "Loki Release Follow Up"
description: "It’s only been a short couple of weeks since we released the latest version of elementary OS, but we already have so much to share! We’re happy to say that Loki has already passed 45,000 downloads, from 157 different countries since release with 2/3rds of those downloads coming from closed sourced OSes. We’re super proud to be reaching people all over the world who are new to an Open Source operating system. Congratulations to everyone who switched!"

## Updates

Unlike other Long Term Support distributions, elementary has a policy of continuing to push real fixes and new features during the lifecycle of a release. We’ve gotten a lot of feedback about Loki and we want to share a few things that we’ve already addressed since it came out:

* Felipe pushed a fixed for an occasional panel crash that happened when connecting to a new network. He also pushed a fix to the Screenshot utility so that the app window won’t photobomb your shot in Conceal Text mode.

* Adam fixed a crash that happened when scrolling the sound indicator icon and made several improvements to the robustness of Parental Controls.

* Corentin made sure account nicknames in Mail aren’t overwritten when synced with Online Accounts

* Cassidy, Felipe, and I (Daniel) pushed a number of fixes to Mouse & Touchpad settings including the ability to set the pointer speed much slower and a handy snap point to set it back to the default setting.

* Jeremy has spent a bit of time on the way we organize the updates view of AppCenter, making sure that it sorts correctly and displays updates cleanly. You’ll also now see the title of the category you’re currently browsing at the top of the window.

* Cody imported a new Intel driver which improves performance on some new Intel Skylake chipsets

* It’s also worth mentioning that several apps received updated translations.

There’s definitely more where that came from! Be sure to check AppCenter frequently for updates, and if you notice an issue [let us know about it](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Felementary.io%2Fdocs%2Fcode%2Freference%23reporting-bugs&t=NzE3YzNmMjA1NGQxNTRiMzUxNTRiMjlkM2JiMTkwOGI2NzZmNTg3Mix1STBLZnZjcw%3D%3D&b=t%3AibgnuWZACL4bF6AGZWyLrg&m=0) by reporting the issue in Launchpad.

## Great Press

We’ve had excellent reception from the press and we want to share a few things that have really made us smile:

* Chris Fisher of the Linux Action Show said, [“[Loki] is one of the most polished Linux distributions period.”](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/102976/looking-at-loki-las-434/)

* Full-stack web developer Adam Merrifield after a week with Loki wrote, [“Loki is the best Linux distribution to ever grace the screen of any of my computers.”](https://adam.merrifield.ca/2016/09/17/a-week-with-elementary-os-loki-0-4-0/)

* Jack Wallen of Linux.com wrote that Loki is, [“one of the most elegant and well-designed Linux desktops on the planet.”](https://www.linux.com/learn/elementary-os-loki-has-arrived)

And there are many other articles and emails and tweets that we’ve received to similar effect. We’re very excited to see that journalists and bloggers and regular folks are enjoying Loki just as much as we are.

## A Quick Note for Beta Testers

If you installed the Loki Beta, **you’re still on the unstable/daily updates channel**. If you’d like to continue testing updates as we code them, you’re all set. You’re still beta testing and the environment you’re living in is great for developers. But if you want a stable system with only stable updates, **you need to install the stable release**. Be aware that you may receive updates that cause regressions or come with issues.

## Thanks for Your Support!
