In case you missed it, we shipped a major fix for an issue that caused updates not to appear. If you haven’t already, you’ll want to [read our post on applying the fix](https://medium.com/elementaryos/important-update-released-501c9d9f28b) so that you can enjoy all the great stuff that we released in April!

## Sound Indicator

You can now control paired Bluetooth devices (like phones!) from the [sound indicator](https://github.com/elementary/wingpanel-indicator-sound). Additionally, we now show an icon in the panel when an app is using the microphone, making it easy to see at a glance if something starts listening in.

## Power Indicator

The [power indicator](https://github.com/elementary/wingpanel-indicator-power) now shows a brightness slider for controlling the display brightness of backlit devices.

## Screenshot

Our [screenshot tool](https://github.com/elementary/screenshot-tool) saw a number of minor fixes. Most prominently, the suggested file names are now friendlier to web forms by separating numbers with a `.` instead of a `:` . There’s also a new `--clipboard` option when launching from Terminal.

## Look & Feel

We updated the system [stylesheet for elementary OS](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet) with a a few tiny tweaks: we’ve refined InfoBars and they now appear slightly flatter with higher contrast text, destructive action buttons now have better focus styles, and in-app notification “toasts” gained improved button styling, as well as providing some fixes for buttons in “inline” ActionBars.

## Other Minor Updates

An issue was resolved that caused the option for 12 hour or 24 hour time to not show for certain locales. The latest Files includes fixes for SFTP and SMB shares as well as providing better compatibility with input language switching.

In addition to the updates mentioned above, you can always rely on updated translations, stability fixes, and general code cleaning. Make sure to pop open AppCenter and hit “Update All” to get the latest and greatest.
