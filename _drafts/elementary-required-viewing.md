Title: elementary &ldquo;Required&rdquo; Viewing
Date: 2014-06-24 10:23 

Over the years working with [elementary](http://elementaryos.org), I&rsquo;ve come 
across several videos or documentaries that really struck me as fitting in with
the overall ethos and direction of the project.

## Objectified

If you are to pick one video from this list, make it _Objectified_. From the
documentary&rsquo;s site:

> Objectified is a feature-length documentary about our complex relationship 
> with manufactured objects and, by extension, the people who design them. It’s 
> a look at the creativity at work behind everything from toothbrushes to tech 
> gadgets. It’s about the designers who re-examine, re-evaluate and re-invent 
> our manufactured environment on a daily basis. It’s about personal expression, 
> identity, consumerism, and sustainability. 

> Through vérité footage and in-depth conversations, the film documents the 
> creative processes of some of the world’s most influential product designers, 
> and looks at how the things they make impact our lives. What can we learn 
> about who we are, and who we want to be, from the objects with which we 
> surround ourselves?

The well-produced documentary not only features several respected designers, it
explains much of the design thought that goes into everyday items. It&rsquo;s a great
film to get you into the design mindset of elementary.

> creators and the craft. The film follows the dramatic journeys of video game 
> developers as they create and release their games to the world.

> The film is about making video games, but at its core, it&rsquo;s about the 
> creative process, and exposing yourself through your work.

_Indie Game_ is a documentary about several independent video game developers
and their paths to releasing their hit games. It was actually funded on 
[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blinkworks/indie-game-the-movie-the-final-push) 
and sounded pretty interesting to me, so I watched it on Netflix.

It was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. _Indie Game_ evokes the 
all-too-familiar emotions I&mdash;and other members of the open source 
community&mdash;have felt: anticipation, intense passion, uncertainty, dread,
anger, and pride.

While it may be about video game developers, the independent creator perspective
is something that really strikes home with elementary. Plus, we want to be
creating tools that enables independent developers like the ones in _Indie 
Game_ to craft their next big project.

## Megafactories: Tesla Model S

<iframe class="iframe-video" width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pkO5u4AJkwQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I recently came across this forty-five minute documentary on YouTube. It focuses
on the factory and manufacturing process of Tesla Motor&rsquo;s Model S, but it also
shares an exciting perspective on the future of automobiles, manufacturing, and
energy in general. If you&rsquo;re aiming to change the world like elementary, you
need to watch this.
