[Slimbook] <small>([English version])</small> offers several laptops, desktops, mini desktops, and all-in-ones with elementary OS. Based in Spain, they specialize in hardware specifically designed to run Linux-based operating systems. Slimbook joins [existing retailers](/now-shipping-elementary-os) to offer customers an increasingly wide range of devices running elementary OS out of the box while directly supporting elementary with each purchase.

This coincides nicely with Slimbook's recent launch of their new [Essential](https://slimbook.es/essential?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=elementary&utm_campaign=elementary) <small>([English version](https://slimbook.es/en/essential-en?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=elementary&utm_campaign=elementary))</small> line. These 14- and 15-inch laptops are focused on being more affordable while still offering great hardware. They come with 10th-gen Intel Core processors, backlit keyboards, DDR4 memory, and fast NVMe storage—all starting at 499€ as of this post.

Slimbook's joining the program brings the total to over two dozen models from different retailers. For more background on our work with OEMs—including why it's so important to the user experience—see our [Now Shipping elementary OS](/now-shipping-elementary-os) blog post.

## Updates from Existing Retailers

Both [Laptop with Linux] and [Star Labs] have launched additional models with elementary OS.

### Laptop With Linux

Laptop With Linux has launched new [14-inch](https://laptopwithlinux.com/product/tongfang-pf4nu1f/?ref=36&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=elementary&utm_campaign=elementary) and [15.6-inch](https://laptopwithlinux.com/product/tongfang-pf5nu1g-amd-linux-laptop/?ref=36&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=elementary&utm_campaign=elementary) Tongfang laptops with AMD Ryzen processors. These new models sport durable but lightweight magnesium-alloy chassis, IPS displays, and up to 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 4800H processors. As of this post, they start around $740 USD.

These models are also the first from Laptop With Linux to feature their new "Super" key design, referred to in elementary OS with the [Looped Square (⌘) symbol](/why-the-looped-square-symbol). Lastly, Laptop with Linux now ships worldwide with VAT-free checkout for countries outside the EU.

### Star Labs

The new [Lite Mk III](https://starlabs.systems/pages/lite-mk-iii?rfsn=4227837.e8f025) is available for pre-order from Star Labs now. It's a tiny, fanless, but capable laptop with an 11-inch matte IPS display. It rocks a backlit keyboard, glass trackpad, and stereo speakers—and it charges over USB-C. As of this post, it starts at $432 USD.

Star Labs is also bringing Coreboot to the [LabTop Mk IV](https://starlabs.systems/pages/labtop-mk-iv?rfsn=4227837.e8f025) soon; this means faster boot times and a more open and verifiable boot process.
