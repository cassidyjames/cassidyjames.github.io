Photos saw a pretty major overhaul of its main view as it is now styled with Gtk.CSS instead of hardcoded. Right click menus were also cleaned up by placing Contractor items in a submenu. There has also been a substantial amount of code cleaning for a much leaner and simpler code base.

## AppCenter

We pushed out a surprise update to AppCenter at the very beginning of our sprint with some performance improvements and a few other tricks. Apps can now be opened from their info page after installation. You can now also close AppCenter with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Q`. AppCenter now handles `appstream:// `urls as well. Stay tuned for many more big updates coming to AppCenter. During the sprint many more features and improvements were made.

## And More

The CSS that makes Terminal’s background transparent was moved from the elementary stylesheet into the app. This makes Pantheon Terminal a bit more portable to other environments where another stylesheet might be used. Our panel received some performance and stability improvements and improved compatibility with touch devices. Our icon set was updated with a few new icons that will be used in later updates as well as more sizes for existing icons.

In addition to the updates mentioned above, you can always rely on updated translations, stability fixes, and general code cleaning. Make sure to pop open AppCenter and hit “Update All” to get the latest and greatest.
