title: "Our Gtk+ Stylesheet Has Moved"
description: "As a bit of a follow up, over the weekend we decided to move our Gtk+ stylesheet to GitHub where our icons now live. This brings up the total number of our projects using git (and GitHub) and means that our design team now commits almost exclusively on GitHub. We’re excited about the transition and hope that it brings greater visibility and makes derivatives easier to maintain for the wider open source community.To reiterate our previous post, Launchpad is still the home for our desktop apps at the moment for a number of reasons, mostly for its feature-full bug tracking, blueprints, and translations integration. We’re definitely interested to continue exploring GitHub and git in general and we’ll keep everyone updated on our progress."
