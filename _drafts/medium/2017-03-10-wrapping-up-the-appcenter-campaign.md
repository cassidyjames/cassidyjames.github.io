Our [AppCenter campaign on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/appcenter-the-pay-what-you-want-app-store) has officially ended at 28% above our goal! During the 30-day campaign we saw more than four hundred backers come together to contribute over $10,000. We’re overwhelmed with gratitude and excited to head to Denver, Colorado for our sprint.

Earlier this week we ordered proofs of our tees and sweatshirts. They should arrive early next week and we can sign off on them — or make any tweaks — and start the process of fulfilling backer rewards. Our six non-Denver folks are packing their bags to meet up with me and Katie for our AppCenter sprint.

We’d like to thank our 407 backers again; your contributions are how we’re able to meet up in person and have a productive week of designing and hacking on AppCenter and the AppCenter Dashboard. We’d also like to extend our thanks to [System76](https://system76.com); they’ve graciously offered us space to hack, whiteboard, and hang out for this sprint.

We’ll be sure to keep you all updated during and after the sprint via both our [Backer updates](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/appcenter-the-pay-what-you-want-app-store#/updates) and [Medium](https://medium.com/elementaryos).
