## Future?

Ideas for future talks or lightning talks.

#### "Don't read the comments" bingo

Prepare (virtual) bingo cards ahead of time, quick-fire show bad comments from various places like Reddit and blog comments, see who can get a bingo first! Include phrases like "cabal," "hates users," "remove features," etc. (Somewhat joking, but could be part of a longer presentation about managing Internet discourse, maybe?)
